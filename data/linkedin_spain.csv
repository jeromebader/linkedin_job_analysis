Improving the links between CERT and SOC activities is key to manage and investigate escalated cyber incidents to support in times of declared crisis (managed by crisis team and processes)Insider Protection : A user-name and password are no longer sufficient to identify users and ensure all actions performed from internal accounts are legitimate. The Insider protection team is looking at other means such as user activity analysis via innovative technologies to build up a more comprehensive picture of our users and identify the intruders. Traditional enterprises identity based on username and password based credentials with a safe perimeter.

          What we stand for is delegated company spending. On the face of things, it might not sound exciting. But, to us and to our customers, it really is. We believe that the way that work works today is outdated. We think that companies can delegate to their employees more - to support their ownership and to show them trust.

No more expense reports, no more out-of-pocket spending.

Let's put trust in employees so that they can buy what they need when they need it. Future of work stuff, you know?

The Credit Solutions Domain

The credit domain empowers users with better cash flow and ensures they can rely on Pleo for their most critical spending needs. The domain aims to create end-to-end ownership of Credit products and capabilities. We own the design of credit products, risk and financial appetite, revenue model, and infrastructure that is required to deliver it.

By learning from customers’ spending behaviours, we can predict when a customer needs credit at the moment, which is most needed by companies. It also allows us to set the credit terms that fit best their needs. We see Credit both as a product and as a set of capabilities that will help us unlock more value in other products across Pleo.

Quarterly trips to somewhere for team camps (both company-wide ones and team-specific ones). The next will be in Croatia!!!Flex Budget – 2500€ to spend on whatever you want.

So, our Flex Benefits package lets you choose what best suits you. Investment in learning & developing (just check with your team for what's reasonable, we don't have set budgets) 25 days holidays (annual) 

And here are some other nice gestures that we do

Why work here?

Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work.

Based on some pretty amazing Series C-round investment in 2021 we think we're onto something big.

So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 800+ team, from over 74 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal, or Lisbon offices – and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by sensible things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us we'll help you get up the best remote setup possible, and will fly you in for our amazing team camps ✈️

          Our opportunity 

Within the Data and Business Intelligence area, DBI Studio is responsible for building the solutions which support the Group’s decision making and efficiency. We have a truly global reach: our internal clients are Group Functions responsible for the Group’s core processes and Business Units bringing Zurich’s products and services to all geographic areas.

The activity of DBI Studio’s Data Science team is instrumental to Zurich’s transformation into a data-driven organization. Working shoulder to shoulder with engineers, designers, product managers and business stakeholders, we deliver effective models and reusable products. We strive for robustness, safety and clarity. We are adaptable and make it a point to never stick to our comfort zone and constantly push the boundary of the technologies and models available to Zurich.

By joining us, you will be part of a team committed to make things better day after day and to invest in each other’s growth. Your work will support processes and decisions that reach millions of customers and you will gain the experience (and satisfaction!) that only facing problems that you’ve never seen before and overcoming new challenges can bring.

 Your role 

As a data scientist your main responsibilities will involve work collaboratively on building models and analyses to support internal products or the business’s decision processes, producing code and experiments that be reproducible and maintainable as well as informing the group’s digital strategy.

What does that mean in practice?

It means that over the course of just a few months you may be testing computer vision models to assess the damage of a car accident from a photo; you may be tasked with detecting faulty instruments on a factory floor from the data produced by IoT sensors; you may be processing logs to profile web users; or employ large language models to search for concepts through thousands of risk assessment reports, or optimize the condition offerings in our policies. If you thought that the reach of a data scientist within an insurance company would be limited, think again.

Nor should the value that a skilled data scientist can bring be confined to the technical realm! You’ll have the chance to advise core teams with global reach on their digitalization strategy, shape the Group’s AI ethics policies or be involved in every part of the development of a product: from design, to implementation to its financial assessment.

150 years after its foundation, Zurich is still growing and so will your possibilities within it.

Your Skills And Experience

You may have experience building risk scoring models in a bank or studying behavioural patterns in social psychology trials. Perhaps in your free time you have analysed smart contract transaction patterns on crypto platforms. Or you were once asked to optimise the routing of logistical services or the hourly rental price of courts in a tennis club. Maybe during your studies you spent time filtering the massive amount of data produced by particle physics experiments and you now recall with fondness long, late night conversations around the interpretation of p-values. You may have built a system to detect unconscious decision patterns in a corpus of court sentences. It could be that you got tired of always getting the same recommendations on your music streaming platform and tried to reverse-engineer their algorithm. Perhaps you’ve wondered how to use mobile phone signal data to design new bus routes or study how crowds move to optimize the floor layout of a department store.

It doesn’t matter where you come from. The essence of our work is easy: make sense of information; maintain a global perspective (it’s not just about the mathematical model, but rather how it’ll be used); write good code.

As a data scientist your skills and qualifications will ideally include:

 3 years of relevant industry experience (it should be clear by now what we mean by that). If that comes with knowledge of the insurance industry, all the better!  You know your random forest from your logistic regression – and you can explain them clearly to every kind of audience.  You have built a sound knowledge of programming in Python and its most common libraries and frameworks useful for DS (e.g. scikit-learn, pandas, scipy, numpy, networkx, pytorch, keras, pymc3…).  You have hands-on experience with (Py)Spark and can write non-trivial SQL queries,  Have worked in cloud environments, particularly Azure and AWS  And software versioning systems such as Git or SVN are no strangers to you.  You can prove that you can organise, conduct and communicate the results of quantitative experiments;  That you can handle multiple workflows at once, evaluate priorities, work under pressure  And that you work with autonomy and rigour: even in the face of ambiguity, uncertain requirements and lack of information, you plan and get work done.  You can communicate clearly, effectively and empathically  And you know what it means to work in a team.  It goes without saying: in a global organization, fluency in English (written and spoken) is paramount. Additional languages surely won’t hurt. 

Bonus points if you can also show:

 Higher academic education  Knowledge of software engineering basics  Demonstrable experience with seeing your models deployed to production  Experience programming in Scala and R (or indeed some lower-level languages!)  Knowledge of MLOps  Real-world experience with deep learning models  Knowledge of DS platforms such as Dataiku, Knime, DataRobot, H2O etc. 

Additional Information

 As well as a competitive salary and a yearly bonus we offer benefits package which includes: 

 Option to work remotely within Spain even up to 100% - you choose  Flexible working hours  Wide range of internal and external trainings  Free English, German and Spanish classes depending on the needs  Ticket restaurant  Life Insurance  Pension Plan - after 1 year in the company  Referral bonus if you bring other talented people like you  Special banking and insurance conditions  Exclusive Employees discounts 

 Primary work location is Barcelona, Poblenou  . Please apply with your CV in English.

Looking for a challenging and inspiring work environment where you can make a difference? At Zurich millions of individuals and businesses place their trust in our products and services every day. Our 53,000 employees worldwide form the basis of our success, enabling businesses and communities to face a world of risk with confidence. Imagine if you could help people do this all over the world.

Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100 times the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at an unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, ownership, empathy, and collaboration. We value the unique experiences and perspectives that each person brings to The Trade Desk, and we are committed to fostering inclusive spaces where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work every day.

Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally-connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small-medium-sized workplaces globally.

WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:

Our Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; differential privacy across billions of user IDs; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring and technical leadership, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

WHO YOU ARE:

You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment.You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources.You have a product-focused mindset.

We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:

You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.You have over 6 years of experience working in a data-driven role.

Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job.

The Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters.

          WELCOME TO UTOPIA

Music is incredible. It can excite hundreds, and unite thousands. But as an industry, it has been slow, complicated, and disparate. While the tech world has moved into the future, the music industry continues to be shaped by inefficient systems of the past. At Utopia we believe there is a better way. Which is why today we are setting out to transform the entire industry; creating new revenue streams, consolidating the data and decluttering the admin. Unlocking the industry’s full potential by unifying it all in one truly holistic space. Some might call that a Utopia.

Funnily enough, so do we. Welcome to Utopia. Where music lives.

WHAT UTOPIANS DO

The open secret is that the music industry is struggling with the very basics of music accounting: What was played, when and where? Who should get paid and how much?

Utopia Music is bridging the data gap by connecting global consumption, accurate metadata, and fast payments to an industry-wide trust platform. Our goal is to unlock creative value and enable Fair Pay For Every Play to make a better world for Music. The solutions we offer do not threaten to usurp the role of industry incumbents - it is about bringing transparency in the industry and supporting efficient royalty collection for all.

THE ROLE

          What we stand for is delegated company spending. On the face of things, it might not sound exciting. But, to us and to our customers, it really is. We believe that the way that work works today is outdated. We think that companies can delegate to their employees more - to support their ownership and to show them trust.

No more expense reports, no more out-of-pocket spending.

Let's put trust in employees so that they can buy what they need when they need it. Future of work stuff, you know?

The Credit Solutions Domain

The credit domain empowers users with better cash flow and ensures they can rely on Pleo for their most critical spending needs. The domain aims to create end-to-end ownership of Credit products and capabilities. We own the design of credit products, risk and financial appetite, revenue model, and infrastructure that is required to deliver it.

By learning from customers’ spending behaviours, we can predict when a customer needs credit at the moment, which is most needed by companies. It also allows us to set the credit terms that fit best their needs. We see Credit both as a product and as a set of capabilities that will help us unlock more value in other products across Pleo.

So What's Data & Analytics At Pleo Like?

Show me the benefits!
Your own Pleo card (no more out-of-pocket spending) Ability to work remotely (anywhere between the east coast of the Americas to European time zones).. Quarterly trips to somewhere for team camps (both company-wide ones and team-specific ones). The next will be in Croatia!!!Flex Budget – 2500€ to spend on whatever you want.

So, our Flex Benefits package lets you choose what best suits you. Investment in learning & developing (just check with your team for what's reasonable, we don't have set budgets) 25 days holidays (annual) 

And here are some other nice gestures that we do

Why work here?

Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work. Through fintech we've seen a way to impact how people work; we think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending. Based on some pretty amazing Series C-round investment in 2021 we think we're onto something big.

So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 800+ team, from over 74 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal, or Lisbon offices – and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by sensible things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us we'll help you get up the best remote setup possible, and will fly you in for our amazing team camps ✈️

          Our opportunity 

Within the Data and Business Intelligence area, DBI Studio is responsible for building the solutions which support the Group’s decision making and efficiency. We have a truly global reach: our internal clients are Group Functions responsible for the Group’s core processes and Business Units bringing Zurich’s products and services to all geographic areas.

The activity of DBI Studio’s Data Science team is instrumental to Zurich’s transformation into a data-driven organization. Working shoulder to shoulder with engineers, designers, product managers and business stakeholders, we deliver effective models and reusable products. We strive for robustness, safety and clarity. We are adaptable and make it a point to never stick to our comfort zone and constantly push the boundary of the technologies and models available to Zurich.

By joining us, you will be part of a team committed to make things better day after day and to invest in each other’s growth. Your work will support processes and decisions that reach millions of customers and you will gain the experience (and satisfaction!) that only facing problems that you’ve never seen before and overcoming new challenges can bring.

 Your role 

As a data scientist your main responsibilities will involve work collaboratively on building models and analyses to support internal products or the business’s decision processes, producing code and experiments that be reproducible and maintainable as well as informing the group’s digital strategy.

What does that mean in practice?

It means that over the course of just a few months you may be testing computer vision models to assess the damage of a car accident from a photo; you may be tasked with detecting faulty instruments on a factory floor from the data produced by IoT sensors; you may be processing logs to profile web users; or employ large language models to search for concepts through thousands of risk assessment reports, or optimize the condition offerings in our policies. If you thought that the reach of a data scientist within an insurance company would be limited, think again.

Nor should the value that a skilled data scientist can bring be confined to the technical realm! You’ll have the chance to advise core teams with global reach on their digitalization strategy, shape the Group’s AI ethics policies or be involved in every part of the development of a product: from design, to implementation to its financial assessment.

150 years after its foundation, Zurich is still growing and so will your possibilities within it.

Your Skills And Experience

You may have experience building risk scoring models in a bank or studying behavioural patterns in social psychology trials. Perhaps in your free time you have analysed smart contract transaction patterns on crypto platforms. Or you were once asked to optimise the routing of logistical services or the hourly rental price of courts in a tennis club. Maybe during your studies you spent time filtering the massive amount of data produced by particle physics experiments and you now recall with fondness long, late night conversations around the interpretation of p-values. You may have built a system to detect unconscious decision patterns in a corpus of court sentences. It could be that you got tired of always getting the same recommendations on your music streaming platform and tried to reverse-engineer their algorithm. Perhaps you’ve wondered how to use mobile phone signal data to design new bus routes or study how crowds move to optimize the floor layout of a department store.

It doesn’t matter where you come from. The essence of our work is easy: make sense of information; maintain a global perspective (it’s not just about the mathematical model, but rather how it’ll be used); write good code.

As a data scientist your skills and qualifications will ideally include:

 3 years of relevant industry experience (it should be clear by now what we mean by that). If that comes with knowledge of the insurance industry, all the better!  You know your random forest from your logistic regression – and you can explain them clearly to every kind of audience.  You have built a sound knowledge of programming in Python and its most common libraries and frameworks useful for DS (e.g. scikit-learn, pandas, scipy, numpy, networkx, pytorch, keras, pymc3…).  You have hands-on experience with (Py)Spark and can write non-trivial SQL queries,  Have worked in cloud environments, particularly Azure and AWS  And software versioning systems such as Git or SVN are no strangers to you.  You can prove that you can organise, conduct and communicate the results of quantitative experiments;  That you can handle multiple workflows at once, evaluate priorities, work under pressure  And that you work with autonomy and rigour: even in the face of ambiguity, uncertain requirements and lack of information, you plan and get work done.  You can communicate clearly, effectively and empathically  And you know what it means to work in a team.  It goes without saying: in a global organization, fluency in English (written and spoken) is paramount. Additional languages surely won’t hurt. 

Bonus points if you can also show:

 Higher academic education  Knowledge of software engineering basics  Demonstrable experience with seeing your models deployed to production  Experience programming in Scala and R (or indeed some lower-level languages!)  Knowledge of MLOps  Real-world experience with deep learning models  Knowledge of DS platforms such as Dataiku, Knime, DataRobot, H2O etc. 

Additional Information

 As well as a competitive salary and a yearly bonus we offer benefits package which includes: 

 Option to work remotely within Spain even up to 100% - you choose  Flexible working hours  Wide range of internal and external trainings  Free English, German and Spanish classes depending on the needs  Ticket restaurant  Life Insurance  Pension Plan - after 1 year in the company  Referral bonus if you bring other talented people like you  Special banking and insurance conditions  Exclusive Employees discounts 

 Primary work location is Barcelona, Poblenou  . Please apply with your CV in English.

You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; differential privacy across billions of user IDs; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring and technical leadership, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

WHO YOU ARE:

You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.You have a strong sense of data intuition.

To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground.You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE:

You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques.You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents.You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences.You have over 6 years of experience working in a data-driven role.

Description of the job

A vacancy for a Senior Data Scientist with Statistic expertise (m/f) in Airbus Detection and Response Department has arisen within Airbus (Commercial Aircraft) in Getafe. You will join the Cyber Security Department.

About Cyber Security In Airbus

Security is not an option, be part of it!

Today, governments, companies and private individuals are increasingly the target of attacks like theft of intellectual property, sensitive information and even money.

Last year Norton Cybercrime Report estimated a global cost of cybercrime around 150 billion Euros. 

Airbus Group is more and more at risk due to its leading position in the market and the additional risks coming from the Extended Enterprise. We have been facing malware attacks which have become more and more sophisticated over the last months.

 IT Security measures can do a lot, but each of us, as Airbus employees, are the first line of defence. 

What Is Doing The Detection & Response Team

CERT activities such as Threat Intelligence, Threat Hunting & Anticipation and Incident ResponseSOC activities such as strategy for; continuous monitoring, detection, and analysis of potential intrusions in real time and through historical trending on security-relevant data sources to provide situational awareness and reporting on cybersecurity status and incidents. Improving the links between CERT and SOC activities is key to manage and investigate escalated cyber incidents to support in times of declared crisis (managed by crisis team and processes)Insider Protection : A user-name and password are no longer sufficient to identify users and ensure all actions performed from internal accounts are legitimate. The Insider protection team is looking at other means such as user activity analysis via innovative technologies to build up a more comprehensive picture of our users and identify the intruders. Traditional enterprises identity based on username and password based credentials with a safe perimeter. As perimeter concept weakens, we need to track user behavior, context (activity, location etc) and device trust, as additional means of risk based user authentication
