The focus of our team is to build advanced end-2-end solutions that create direct business value for DSV’s divisions, including for example: customs declaration automation; vendor invoices automation; address validation; ETA prediction; and many more to come…

The word “advanced” is used to underline that the use cases we solve tend to have a high degree of complexity, requiring non-deterministic problem solving (i.e. the use of ML/AI), near real-time data processing, a need for high availability, vertical and horizontal scalability and a very high volume of transactions. However, fancy technologies and accurate ML models do not solve the issues at hand alone; we strive to combine our competencies to build holistic solutions where the underlying complexity is hidden for the user to create simple and value-adding experiences.

As a Data Scientist your main responsibilities and activities will be:
 Meeting with stakeholders, discussing their needs and translating them into Data Science problems. Conduct data-driven analyses to provide input to decisions (e.g. which DSV country to start with for a specific use case). Identify proper solutions / models / pre-trained models for particular business cases. Preprocess the data (cleaning, transforming) for ML models. Train ML models on prepared training data using GPU on cloud and on premises. Test and evaluate ML models and present conclusions on further improvements. Use and tweak existing frameworks for running automated testing and evaluation of ML models. Mature models to be available as services for other components. Present your results on an ongoing basis to team mates and business stakeholders.
We expect you to have experience with most of the following technologies/areas:
 Code languages: Python (using both OOP as well as popular libraries such as Pandas, Scikit), Solid understanding of Machine Learning in practice: be able to speak about several projects you participated in, Very good knowledge of Deep Learning with focus on NLP: Transformers, Bert family and where it all came from, ML Frameworks: TensorFlow / PyTorch and other open-source frameworks, ML model serving: TensorFlow serving, Torch serving, Cloud: Azure, Modern software development: good understanding of DevOps, CI/CD, MLOps, Basic knowledge of database technologies such as: Relational database: We use MySQL NoSQL database: We use MongoDB Version control: Git (we use Atlassian BitBucket as a GUI on top of Git)
It Is a Bonus If You Also Have Some Experience With Some Of The Other Technologies That Our Team Works With, Such As
 Code languages: Java, Scala Authentication: Open ID Connect 2.0 (we use Red Hat KeyCloak as identity broker) Containerization: Docker Container orchestration: Kubernetes CI/CD Pipelines: Jenkins (our templates are written in Groovy) Load balancing: NGINX Installation scripts: Ansible Event streaming: Confluent Kafka, K streams Requirements: Jira Documentation: Confluence Frontend technologies: React JS, Material UI, JavaScript/TypeScript, Redux Test framework: Jest
You Like To
 Learn new stuff from knowledgeable colleagues Analyze problems using data and statistics Present your results to teammates and business stakeholders to communicate your findings Solve problems that are too complex for deterministic reasoning with the use of Machine Learning Find pragmatic solutions that balance the need between what is the “optimal” solution from a theoretical standpoint with what is possible within the constraints set by project deadlines, low data quality, etc. Understand the data and the business logic that is related to the ML models you test, train and improve, and you believe that this in-depth understanding is pivotal for being able to deliver valuable results Take a lot of responsibility – both for exciting R&D work to push the boundaries of ML, but also for doing the necessary nitty gritty work it takes to prepare data, evaluate results, debug errors, etc. Ensure that your models can be tested iteratively to compare the individual model’s accuracy and the entire solution’s accuracy over time and to make this visible to stakeholders Break down the solutions into iterations so they can deliver value quickly in MVP versions before they are enriched with more nice-to-have functionality in later iterations Reach out to others for help or clarifications whenever you need it and to ensure alignment with others Make realistic mockups of data to allow you to test things swiftly on synthetic data before you get access to production data
We Are An Ambitious Team With a Flat Hierarchy And a Mix Of Young And Very Experienced Persons, Who Are Working According To The Following Principles
 We celebrate victories together We take responsibility for mistakes and learn from them We design for scale but build only for the near future We value working software and informal alignment over tedious documentation We make decisions based on knowledge and insight rather than hierarchical structures Decisions are the product of conversations between people with different competencies (not one person) Everyone can speak their honest opinion
We have all the needed competencies to build awesome products inside the team: Product owner, Business analysts, Application developers (frontend + backend), Data engineers, Data scientists, ML engineers, DevOps engineers.

Job / Environment
 Your job location will be Portugal (Lisboa, Saldanha) and you will be part of DSV Global IT with peers working in remote teams across the Globe International Environment Permanent Contract with 35h / week

Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work.

Based on some pretty amazing Series C-round investment in 2021 we think we're onto something big.

So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 800+ team, from over 74 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal, or Lisbon offices – and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by sensible things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us we'll help you get up the best remote setup possible, and will fly you in for our amazing team camps ✈️

          Who are we?

WTX was recently founded to disrupt how heavy-duty vehicles trade globally and we believe the current process of buying or selling trucks worldwide is too complicated, nontransparent, and underoptimized. It doesn't need to be this way…

Our mission is to make the whole experience of trading trucks globally seamless, from finding a truck online to more efficiently and reliably being delivered with matching technology.

We are powered by the KI group, investors, and partners in the industry with a proven track record of co-founding and running successful and impactful businesses worldwide.

The data team is now starting and is responsible for building solutions that facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers of our platform. We're aiming to create a personalized experience leveraged by technology and data optimizing how people find and buy trucks while at the same time creating solutions that reduce the complexity of the fulfillment process by finding best allocations and optimal routes.

We have a remote-friendly policy, so our team members are able to work from home but also leverage our cool office in the center of Lisbon (Avenida Almirante Reis).

          We believe in a world where growth thrives across borders and cultures. That's why our Founder and CEO Rick Hammell started Atlas, coining the term Employer of Record (EOR) simultaneously. As an EOR, Atlas employs people to work for companies anywhere in the world. Before we came along, the only businesses offering a similar solution were essentially brokers. They'd outsource your HR and payroll services to third-party providers in different countries. Today, we're the only 100% Direct EOR in the world, partnering with clients to get to market 82% faster, at a reduced cost, and with lower risk through local expertise in over 160 countries.

Atlas technology powers the idea that companies can employ whoever they want, wherever they are in the world. Through our cloud-based platform, we deliver the Human Resources infrastructure that underpins international growth, leaving companies free to focus on the strategy that makes it happen. We partner with our clients through their international life cycle from the first dip in the global pool until the moment it's time to set up their own entities and run payroll. Atlas is here from point A to point Z.

The future of work is borderless, and so are we. So, it helps that our people are located around the globe — in the US, UK, India, China and beyond — and speak 90+ languages. Diversity and inclusion are at our core.

We're excited about our next phase of growth. We're launching new tech, adding new solutions and now we're looking for YOU — eager for a challenge, energized by innovation and aligned with our mission to deliver a future of work without borders.

 Commitment towards work/life balance
At BNP Paribas we care about our employees wellbeing and promote a culture of good integration between work and rest.

Only through this balance we may all be at our best while working.

Within this framework, eligible employees can benefit from flexible remote working modalities adapted to our hybrid working environment.
