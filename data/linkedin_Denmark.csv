          What we stand for is delegated company spending. On the face of things, it might not sound exciting. But, to us and to our customers, it really is. We believe that the way that work works today is outdated. We think that companies can delegate to their employees more - to support their ownership and to show them trust.

No more expense reports, no more out-of-pocket spending.

Let's put trust in employees so that they can buy what they need when they need it. Future of work stuff, you know?

The Credit Solutions Domain

The credit domain empowers users with better cash flow and ensures they can rely on Pleo for their most critical spending needs. The domain aims to create end-to-end ownership of Credit products and capabilities. We own the design of credit products, risk and financial appetite, revenue model, and infrastructure that is required to deliver it.

By learning from customers’ spending behaviours, we can predict when a customer needs credit at the moment, which is most needed by companies. It also allows us to set the credit terms that fit best their needs. We see Credit both as a product and as a set of capabilities that will help us unlock more value in other products across Pleo.

Show me the benefits!
Your own Pleo card (no more out-of-pocket spending) Ability to work remotely (anywhere between the east coast of the Americas to European time zones).. Quarterly trips to somewhere for team camps (both company-wide ones and team-specific ones). The next will be in Croatia!!!Flex Budget – 2500€ to spend on whatever you want.

So, our Flex Benefits package lets you choose what best suits you. Investment in learning & developing (just check with your team for what's reasonable, we don't have set budgets) 25 days holidays (annual) 

And here are some other nice gestures that we do

Why work here?

Working at Pleo means you're working on something very exciting: the future of work.

Based on some pretty amazing Series C-round investment in 2021 we think we're onto something big.

So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 800+ team, from over 74 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal, or Lisbon offices – and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by sensible things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us we'll help you get up the best remote setup possible, and will fly you in for our amazing team camps ✈️

Politiets Efterretningstjeneste identificerer, forebygger, efterforsker og imødegår trusler mod friheden, demokratiet og sikkerheden i det danske samfund. Det stiller store krav til opgaveløsningen i en organisation, hvor en effektiv økonomistyring af tjenestens finanslovsbevilling udgør et afgørende fundament for, at vi som sikkerheds- og efterretningstjeneste lykkedes med vores samfundskritiske opgave.

Vi tilbyder en central rolle som Data Scientist i Økonomisektionen i Center for Kapacitetsstyring, hvor du bidrager til den fortsatte udvikling med at styrke og konsolidere PET’s økonomistyring. Du bliver en del af Økonomisektionen, der har som målsætning at løfte økonomistyringen til et nyt niveau, hvor fokus ikke kun er på den finansielle styring, men også på aktivitets- og ressourcestyringen. Vi er i fuld gang med at nytænke og udvikle den løbende budgetopfølgning og budgetlægning. I den forbindelse søger vi en Data Scientist, der vil gå forrest i den videre udvikling af systemunderstøttelsen i Python og dermed være med til at sætte sit personlige præg på, hvordan vi udvikler vores styring af en kompleks unik instans. På sig vil arbejdet med data blive udvidet til centerets øvrige sektioner: Indløb, Operativ Logistik og Facility.

Vi tilbyder dig en række spændende opgaver, hvor du får faglige udfordringer og muligheden for at bidrage til den spændende proces, hvor vi arbejder med at koble den finansielle styring med aktivitets- og ressourcestyringen.

Du får en masse dedikerede kollegaer, der vil se frem til at samarbejde med dig og skubbe til din udvikling, ligesom de forventer, at du gør det samme ved dem. I PET investerer vi i løbende at udvikle og dygtiggøre medarbejdere på alle niveauer.

Om dig

Du evner at formidle komplekse problemstillinger skriftligt og mundtligt. Du er analytisk og løsningsorienteret, uden at miste blikket for detaljen. Du skal have en sans for programmering, strukturering af data og udvikling af systemer, da du vil stå i front med at udvikle vores budgetopfølgning og budgetlægning samt andre relaterede systemer. Erfaring med Python er fortrukken, men ikke et krav, hvis du er lærenem og har anden erfaring med programmering i lignende sprog.

Vi byder din dedikation, din idérigdom og dine gode samarbejdsevner velkommen. Du skal også bruge din gode dømmekraft til at træffe de rette valg og være robust, når vilkårene omkring dig ændres. PET er en aktiv del af samfundet, hvorfor din nysgerrighed på omverdenen og nye opgaver er gode forudsætninger for at lykkes.

          Vil du være med til at levere moderne, enkle automatiseringsløsninger, der sikrer effektiv forretningsudvikling af personbeskatning i Danmark? Trives du med at arbejde agilt og teambaseret i tæt samarbejde med forretningen, mens du har det sjovt? Så er du højst sandsynlig vores nye kollega i Kontoret for Data, Analyse og Procesoptimering.

Lidt om kontoret

Kontorets formål er at sikre løbende forretningsudvikling af personbeskatningen i Danmark.

Vi startede med at arbejde målrettet med automatisering sidste år, så du bliver en del af et kontor præget af nytænkning, kontinuerlig metodeafprøvning og stor entusiasme. I løbet af det sidste år har vi idriftsat seks automatiserede løsninger til sagsbehandlingen og planlægger at levere et betydeligt større antal i løbet af 2022. Vi står med andre ord ved starten af en større digital transformation af de interne processer, og hvis du har lyst, så har vi flere pladser ved bordet. Vi skal ikke hjem, vi skal videre!

Arbejdet er for nuværende centreret om to beslægtede automatiseringsprojekter. Vi har en stor back-log med automatiseringsopgaver, som vi gerne vil have flere kollegaer til at give flyvehøjde. Du får mulighed for at arbejde med dine løsninger end-to-end lige fra potentialeafdækning over procesanalyser og kravspecifikationer til udvikling, test og til sidst idriftsættelse hos brugerne.

Udviklingen foregår indtil videre i Power Automate, som er vores teknologiramme, men vi er hele tiden nysgerrige på teknologier. Vi laver også machine learning-modeller, som du også kan komme til at arbejde med på sigt, hvis du har lyst og kompetencer.

Arbejdet er funderet i en struktureret tilgang til forretningsudvikling via en værktøjskasse med udviklingsmetoder, som vi konstant opdaterer. Vi anvender fx en agil mødestruktur, som er tilpasset opgaven, hvor vi planlægger vores udvikleropgaver i 14-dages sprints med bl.a. daglige stand-ups, midway reviews og retrospectives, ligesom vi arbejder i faste teams.

Du skal

Udvikle end-to-end løsninger igennem Microsoft Power Platform til vores driftsenheder i nært samarbejde med sagsbehandlerkollegaerSikre udnyttelse af eksisterende og nye teknologier med fokus på at opnå det største potentiale igennem automatiseringImplementere, drifte og vedligeholde nuværende og nyudviklede løsninger i samarbejde med dine øvrige udviklerkollegaerFokusere på kontinuerlige forbedringer, udbygge overvågning og logningFormidle din teknologividen til kollegaer og ledelse samt uddanne kollegaer, så de selv kan bruge løsningerne efter idriftsættelse.

Som udvikler hos os vil du, i samarbejde med et team af andre dygtige udviklere, testere, projektleder og product owner, udvikle løsninger til brug for fremtidens digitale sagsbehandling. Vi fordeler opgaverne i teamet i forhold til kompetencer og interesser, og opgaverne kan derfor i nogen udstrækning tilpasses til dine personlige præferencer. Du kan fx deltage i workflow analyser forud for udviklingsprocessen, men hvis du omvendt fortrækker, at dine kolleger leverer dem til dig, så du kan starte med at udvikle de digitale løsninger, så er det også muligt. Det vigtigste er, at vi sammen skaber et match mellem dine ønsker og kompetencer og den konkrete opgave.

Om dig

Du har erfaring med eller interesse for C#, Python, Javascript, SQL, R, Regular expression eller noget syvende. Vi er mere interesseret i dine kompetencer og din personlighed end din uddannelsesmæssige baggrund, men du er måske RPA/software developer, datamatiker, data scientist eller også har du opnået din erfaring gennem tidligere jobs eller interesseDu har en passion for teknologi og følger med i udviklingen, og kan se hvordan Skattestyrelsen kan anvende både nuværende og kommende teknologier til at accelerere forretningsudviklingen. Du nøjes ikke med at tale om teknologier – du er hands-on på eksekvering af teknologierneDa dine kommende kollegaer er både ansvarsbevidste, imødekommende, proaktive, har hang til humor og ofte samtidig har mange bolde i luften på én gang, vil du passe bedst ind, hvis du kan se dig selv i sådan et team.

Velkommen om bord

Du bliver en del af et rigtig godt hold bestående af en kontorchef og 20 meget forskellige medarbejdere, som kommer rigtig godt ud af det med hinanden. Inden for automatisering er vi pt. fire udviklere og yderligere fire kolleger, som hjælper med proceskortlægning og –optimering samt projektledelseVi sætter stor pris på sparring og udveksling af erfaringer blandt kollegaer – og vi husker altid på, at det skal være sjovt at gå på arbejde. Derfor dyrker vi også teambuilding som en fast del af vores arbejdsugeVi er vilde med vores arbejde og knokler for at opnå resultater, men vi nyder også at have fri. Vi har alle familie, børn, venner eller fritidsinteresser, som vi elsker at bruge tid på. Derfor går vi alle op i, at der skal være balance mellem arbejde og privatlivDu får et omfattende introduktionsforløb med mentorordning og sidemandsoplæringSkatteministeriet lægger vægt på at understøtte fleksible arbejdsvilkår, og rammerne for arbejdstilrettelæggelsen drøftes mellem leder og medarbejder med udgangspunkt i den samlede opgaveløsning.
