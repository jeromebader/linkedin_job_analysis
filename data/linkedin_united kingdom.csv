          hackajob is a SaaS-enabled marketplace that allows companies to scale their tech teams today, whilst building their talent of tomorrow.


Technology is driving the world forward at an unprecedented rate. Every company has woken up to realise they need to place technology at the heart of their strategy or they'll soon be extinct. And at its core, this transformation will be driven by great people.


But how great people and great companies find each other is broken. It's opaque, biased and plagued by a terrible experience. And as the demand for technical talent explodes, not enough is being done to create the talent for tomorrow.


We're changing this with radical transparency, best-in-class service and a long-term approach to talent, all powered by technology.


We see a world where technical talent has an incredible experience developing their career and finding the right company to unleash their full potential, whilst employers are able to attract, nurture and retain the talent they need to thrive in the technical economy.


Requirements:

We are looking for a Lead Data Scientist to join our product organisation and help us to develop and enhance the analytical and predictive capabilities of the hackajob platform.






Product at hackajobAs we scale our product and tech organisation, we're building durable product teams that are empowered to solve customer problems. As a Data Scientist in this model, you'll work within a cross functional team alongside a Product Manager, taking ownership of big problems from discovery to delivery and measuring outcomes and impact. This is intentionally distinct from the often seen feature team model where a ""higher-up"" hands down a list of features to build. We're not there yet, but we're making steps in the right direction.

          Data Scientist (Private Banking) | up to £50k + 20% pension + 30% bonus + HUGE array of private banking benefits
So who are we recruiting for then?
They are one of Western Europe’s oldest and most exclusive private banking organizations – seen as a pillar within the establishment. Yet they are nimble and ambitious when it comes to the application of technology in order to cater to arguably the most demanding and diverse group of customers in the world.
To do that, the business backs it’s people to fulfil life’s hopes and dreams; their values drive their operations and are reflected in how they deliver their services.
Based in central London, this private financial services is looking for individuals who would be happy with hybrid working.
The office is like no other. No superficial grass. There is however a Michelin Star experience for staff members choosing to dine for lunch within the heavily subsidised staff canteen.
The benefits package is also unrivalled – headline perks for this role include 30% bonus and 20% non-contributory pension. Outside of this there is private medical, dental, and a whole host of other benefits to cater for every individual.
Having successfully recruited into this team twice within the last 12 months, we are now looking to add a further Data Scientist to the team as the bank eyes further investment areas for technology within the bank.
Fine you got me, what do I need to look like?
This Data Science role will sit directly within the data science branch of the bank. This is an ideal role for someone with 2-3 years with non-direct financial services data science experience looking to move into a financial services / banking data science role.
We are looking for someone with an active interest in the application of data science within banking.
You will be using SQL and developing some of the logic for determining the meaning of data. You might be working on customer profiling or machine learning models. You’ll ideally be using R or Python.
You might have some Power BI experience or look forward to the prospect of some training around that.
That's all well and good, but what will I be working on?
As this is a relatively small organization you won’t always be working on the ‘sexy’ projects like NLP on unstructured data sets- sometimes you might be working on some data engineering. We’re ideally looking for a candidate who would want to do this alongside the more exciting projects.
Talking about projects that might peak your interest, projects in this area include developing new strategic tools internally, developing new products and supporting their promotion with arguably the most exciting and dynamic group of customers in the UK, to projects looking at spend and credit cards.
Can you use your crystal ball to tell me my future?
This is a priority area for the bank and there are multiple long term workstreams with huge 'land grab' opportunities available to shape your own long-term progression here. The bank has a significant L&D budget per person alongside structural training put in place via external providers already. The only limit to your progression here will be your ambition.
We will appoint as soon as we come across the right candidate so please don’t delay in hitting apply.
To be considered, please click apply. If you have any questions relating to the requirements, please call Zack Raja at Talentometry Limited a call on 07380315293

          Infogrid is helping protect the planet and improve the lives of billions of people by making every building a smart building.

Our goal is to be the global provider for connected devices in smart buildings. We already handle millions of events every day from tens of thousands of sensors and we’d like you to help us scale that by an order of magnitude over the coming months.

Sustainability is at our heart; buildings account for 39% of global carbon emissions and we’re creating real solutions to impact this!

As a result we can offer insights, recommended actions, and predictions to aid planning in a real-time fashion never before possible or practical - for reasons both of hardware availability as well as data storage and processing. We innovate at the edge of what can be done in the new era of IoT, and data science is central to the company’s goal of offering ever-more useful insights to our clients.

We maintain strong software development practices at all times and, above all, a mindset focussed on deployment. It is through this culture the data science team ensures its effectiveness and ability to quickly deliver value to our clients.

The work you will do will have a direct, measurable impact on the bottom line of the company.

          What we stand for is delegated company spending. On the face of things, it might not sound exciting. But, to us and to our customers, it really is.

So, in a nutshell, that's Pleo. Today we are a 800+ team, from over 74 nations, sitting in our Copenhagen HQ, London, Stockholm, Berlin, Madrid, Montreal, or Lisbon offices – and quite a few full-time remotes in 35 other countries! Being HQ'd out of Copenhagen means we're inspired by sensible things like a good work-life balance. If you don't work in the office with us we'll help you get up the best remote setup possible, and will fly you in for our amazing team camps ✈️

Our Mission

Clarity AI brings societal impact to markets, and what that means to us is that we illuminate paths to a more sustainable world.

We do that by building-in a customizable, scalable sustainability tech kit to our clients existing workflows, which empowers them to efficiently and confidently assess, analyze and report on anything valuable to them or their clients and everything required by regulation.

We are a sustainability tech company, founded in 2017. We leverage AI and machine learning technologies to ensure sustainability dimensions are a focal point of decision making for professional investors, corporates and consumers..

In regards to financial markets, participants there have used ESG indicators (Environmental, Social and Governance) to evaluate dimensions of risk and impact. However, this kind of assessment is limited: it only considers how companies behave in these three dimensions but doesn’t consider the products and services the companies provide as part of their contribution, positive or negative, to society. Leveraging scientific research and the latest technologies, we provide decision makers with the most transparent, reliable and comprehensive capabilities and tools to assess, analyze and report on social and environmental impact.

We have received several awards that show the value that we are providing to the market:
World Economic Forum PioneerOne of the most innovative projects in the US. Harvard Innovation LabTop startup with impact worldwide by IMPACT Growth 2017Top 10 Fintech startup worldwide by BBVA Open TalentYoung Global Leader to Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela 2017

We require excellence in everything we do with individual expertise as a key dimension to our success. We require everyone to not just talk the talk when it comes to ethics and values, but also to walk the walk and live those values by example.

We are different. We work hard to become the best place to work and pride ourselves on our culture:
Data-driven: Promoting objective, fact-based and solution-oriented discussions.Independent: Accessible and unbiased, we aren’t satisfied with the traditional way of doing things.Transparent: Communicating feedback transparently, constructively and in real-time.Achievement-oriented: Demanding excellence and celebrating and rewarding the best..Flexible: Working flexibly in the broadest sense (e.g., schedule, location, vacation, styles).

Our Team

Having doubled our headcount in 2021, we are now a team of more than 200 highly passionate individuals coming from 30 different nationalities and composed of professionals from leading tech, consulting and banking firms, entrepreneurs, PhDs from top research institutions, and MBA graduates from top business schools. Our headquarters are in New York City, and we have additional offices in London, Madrid and Abu Dhabi. Additionally, we have a strong remote-workforce of team members located in 13 different countries. Together, we have established Clarity AI as a leading company backed by investors and strategic partners such as BlackRock, SoftBank and Deutsche Börse who believe in us and share our goals.

Our Founder and CEO, Rebeca Minguela, is a successful entrepreneur who has been recognized as one of the most distinguished leaders under the age of 40 by prestigious institutions like the World Economic Forum. Rebeca is joined by a superior leadership team coming from diverse backgrounds, countries and experiences.

          Dyson is a global technology company with a unique philosophy - to solve problems that others ignore, first. It transforms every category it enters with radical and iconic re-inventions that work, perform and look very different.

Five years ago 80% of Dyson’s business was full-sized vacuum cleaners. Today, its digital motor powered cordless vacuums, robots, Airblade hand dryers, bladeless fans, humidifiers, purifiers and heaters are powering its growth in 75 countries around the world. 2015 saw the addition of Jake Dyson Light to the portfolio, and in April 2016 Dyson took its biggest leap yet, revolutionising the world of health and personal care with the launch of the Dyson Supersonic™ Hairdryer and since then bringing new pioneering Personal Care machines to market through Dyson Airwrap and Dyson Coralle.

Dyson is rapidly expanding; in its new and core categories, and across all of its global markets. The next five years are going to be Dyson’s biggest and busiest yet. By 2025, there will be 100 new machines, 3 new product portfolios and Dyson’s headcount will have grown. With this pace of growth, these ambitious plans, and the complexities of global expansion, it is natural that Dyson is now thinking about the best ways to organise itself and manage its exciting new product ranges to best effect.

Dyson’s culture is unique; dynamic, inventive, technology-obsessed and decidedly un-corporate. The mindset is geared to constant change and Dyson’s pace brings constant challenge. It’s not easy or comfortable, but it’s this way of working that drives performance. Dyson suits people with the courage and resilience to find their own way, spotting opportunities where others don’t, and having the self-belief to persevere where others give up. “Good enough” isn’t good enough. Experiences are more important than experience. And attitude counts as much as aptitude.

Competitors are expanding reach and bringing products into the marketplace. However, Dyson differentiates through our superior technology and also the unique experiences that we bring to our Owners. Connectivity gives us a unique platform to provide differentiating experiences for our Owners through the App. However, we need to manage this ambition in a more efficient and agile way, bringing new technology to markets faster, reacting to Owner expectations quicker and leading the market in more innovative ways.

Dyson Connectivity

The next period of Dyson’s growth will see us taking our technology into more markets, doubling the business and quadrupling Direct. It will see our Owner base grow rapidly and a focus on both acquiring more Owners and retaining the Owners we have.

Our vision is to help Dyson owners get the very best out of  their Dyson machines, through effortless ownership and personalised care , by assisting them in simple, elegant and unexpected  ways, using technology and data intelligently. 

Our mission is to form a high-performing team to define a world-class Connected strategy and a reimagined Connected way of working and governance, harnessing data to create superior product and owner experiences, building a platform of trust with our owners and a community of Dyson advocates who will return to purchase from us again.

Connectitivy will rely heavily on harnessing the power of data to provide insights back to the various areas of the business – NPI, RDD, Customer Services, Owner experience and GTM teams, to help make data based decisions. Connectivity will also help us provide a more agile, mission based operating model. One which will enable us to continue our journey but in a more structured and efficient ways.

We are on an exciting data journey where our emphasis is around providing a better usage experience for our Owners.

In 2019, with 85,000 customers while steadily onboarding 2,500 more each month, we knew our customers could be happier, so we ripped up the rule book. To become genuinely customer-first in our culture and thinking, we identified all our customers' pain points and created 'The Wall of Pain'. That's when we knew that to offer the best solutions, we needed to build a new product.

Enter, Dojo.

Dojo represents an enormous organisational shift; we had to restructure how we thought and did things. In a year since we officially launched Dojo, we've welcomed over 20,000 new customers, 500 new team members and called two brand new offices home. We've evolved into a dynamic, product-led business creating our own payments products, integrated card machines and transaction monitoring app. Here, we go home each day knowing we've made a difference —our industry-leading NPS score and 5-star Trustpilot rating tells us that!

At Dojo, we are curious, relentless and customer-obsessed. Our ambition is much greater than getting business owners paid. We're turning transactions into meaningful relationships with a set of tools and technology designed to empower businesses to thrive in the experience economy.

Enabled by technology, but powered by people.

As we enter our next growth phase and embark on another exciting shift towards a B2B2C model following the acquisition of queue-management system and consumer app, Walkup, we have a lot of work to do. Over the next year, the business will transform again as we steady the ship for multinational growth and product diversification. We're looking for people who can enhance our agility, ambition and risk-taking mentality while turning us into a well-oiled machine that's well-positioned to shape the experience economy.

316|United Kingdom|data scientist|Senior Data Scientist|Faculty|London, England, United Kingdom|1 week ago|64 applicants|On-site|Full-time|Mid-Senior level|51-200 employees|IT Services and IT Consulting|"
          Faculty is one of Europe's leading applied artificial intelligence companies. We build, deploy and operate AI solutions to increase our customers' performance and help them realise their full potential. We believe that AI should be trustworthy, impactful and beneficial across society. Those principles have shaped our work with more than 230 organisations across the public and private sectors as we help them use AI to understand more deeply, make better decisions and act faster.


What you'll be doing:


As a Senior Data Scientist you will lead project teams that deliver bespoke algorithms to our clients. You will be responsible for conceiving the data science approach, for designing the associated software architecture, and for ensuring that best practices are followed throughout. You will directly contribute to the code base of the project with a specific focus on the components that are difficult or require experience to implement. Examples of the type of project you might work on include using Bayesian hierarchical modelling to develop an early warning system for the NHS during the COVID-19 pandemic, modelling 3D point cloud data to identify and measure assets for Network Rail, and using NLP to identify topics in market research.


You will help our excellent commercial team build strong relationships with clients, shaping the direction of both current and future projects. Particularly in the initial stages of commercial engagements, you will guide the process of defining the scope of projects to come with an emphasis on technical feasibility. We consider this work as fundamental towards ensuring that Faculty can continue to deliver high-quality software within the allocated timeframes.


You will play an important role in the development of others at Faculty by acting as the designated mentor of a small number of data scientists, and by supporting the professional growth of data scientists on the project team. The latter includes giving targeted support where needed, and providing step-up opportunities where helpful.


Faculty has earned wide recognition as a leader in practical data science. You will actively contribute to the growth of this reputation by delivering courses to high-value clients, by talking at major conferences, by participating in external roundtables, or by contributing to large-scale open-source projects. You will also have the opportunity to teach on the fellowship about topics that range from basic statistics to reinforcement learning, and to mentor the fellows through their 6-week project.


Thanks to Faculty platform, you will have access to powerful computational resources, and you will enjoy the comforts of fast configuration, secure collaboration and easy deployment. Because your work in data science will inform the development of our AI products, you will often collaborate with software engineers and designers from our dedicated product team.


Who we're looking for:


 Mid to Senior experience in either a professional data science position or a quantitative academic field Strong programming skills as evidenced by earlier work in data science or software engineering. Although your programming language of choice (e.g. R, MATLAB or C) is not important, we do require the ability to become a fluent Python programmer in a short timeframe An excellent command of the basic libraries for data science (e.g. NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn) and familiarity with a deep-learning framework (e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe) A high level of mathematical competence and proficiency in statistics A solid grasp of essentially all of the standard data science techniques, for example, supervised/unsupervised machine learning, model cross validation, Bayesian inference, time-series analysis, simple NLP, effective SQL database querying, or using/writing simple APIs for models. We regard the ability to develop new algorithms when an innovative solution is needed as a fundamental skill A leadership mindset focussed on growing the technical capabilities of the team; a caring attitude towards the personal and professional development of other data scientists; enthusiasm for nurturing a collaborative and dynamic culture An appreciation for the scientific method as applied to the commercial world; a talent for converting business problems into a mathematical framework; resourcefulness in overcoming difficulties through creativity and commitment; a rigorous mindset in evaluating the performance and impact of models upon deployment Some commercial experience, particularly if this involved client-facing work or project management; eagerness to work alongside our clients; business awareness and an ability to gauge the commercial value of projects; outstanding written and verbal communication skills; persuasiveness when presenting to a large or important audience Experience leading a team of data scientists (to deliver innovative work according to a strict timeline) as well as experience in composing a project plan, in assessing its technical feasibility, and in estimating the time to delivery 
What we can offer you:


You'll join a diverse and distinctive team. We all come from different personal, professional and organisational backgrounds. We all have one thing in common: we are driven by a deep intellectual curiosity that powers us forward each day. This curiosity pushes us to seek truth and understanding in everything we do, to execute work in a nimble and pragmatic manner, to foster talent in one another and always to challenge assumptions.


Faculty is the professional challenge of a lifetime. You'll be surrounded by an impressive group of brilliant minds working to advance our goal of making artificial intelligence real. Our consultants, product developers, business development specialists, operations professionals and more all bring something unique to Faculty, and you'll learn something new from everyone you meet. You'll also have the opportunity to make your mark on a high-growth start-up now poised to expand internationally.


Fostering talent is one of our core values, it's built into our culture and what we offer. An incredible, unique learning and development system: Faculty was founded by people who are passionate about continuous learning, and adding value to our people. Genuinely flexible working: We believe people have needs, responsibilities and interests that require something different to a strict working day. We trust people to organise and take accountability for their own work and do our best to support their lives outside Faculty. Equity, we want you to benefit from Faculty's growth and success. Unlimited holidays: We encourage each other to use this time to take a break, work on personal projects, or to spend time with their friends and family. Fantastic private health, optical and dental cover, including 24/7 unlimited virtual private GP appointments. Breakfast and more fruit, drinks and snacks than you could ever eat (for office-based employees). Did we mention Yoga? You'll make friends and professional connections that will last a lifetime. We work hard and make sure we enjoy what we do. So we have frequent socials and informal get-togethers to help make sure you enjoy your time with us.

You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to work on problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages; graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data; differential privacy across billions of user IDs; and causal inference with missing data - to name a few.Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring and technical leadership, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them.

WHO YOU ARE:

You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing.You have a strong sense of data intuition.

What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked.

          About Us

Description

Innovation is fuelled by the power of possibilities. A few years ago, it was virtually impossible to innovate because building software needed a degree, it was simply too expensive, too complex, too risky and ultimately too inefficient. That’s why only 16% of projects were ever done on budget and 78% failed.

We're changing that. We’re flipping software development on its head and kicking out the notion that you need to be an expert or do boot camps to learn how to make your app. Builder.ai’s platform lets you order the perfect software app for whatever problem you’re trying to solve. Our AI powered assembly line brings together Lego-like reusable features and experts from around the world to bring world-class ideas to life – ANYONE’s world-class ideas.

Building software needs to be like ordering pizza – pick what you want, get recommendations for the features you need and simply wait till it's cooked and ready for you.

Our human-assisted AI platform helps anyone build, run & scale tailor-made software. Everyone from the bakery in Riyadh and nursery in London, to large fortune 100 companies like the BBC or Pepsi.

Life at Builder

It’s a place where everything moves at lightning pace and most definitely not for the faint hearted. We celebrate diversity, push everyone to do more with less and yet provide a culture that allows everyone to experiment, push boundaries and learn by doing. Every Builder runs to our core value system of HEARTT (Heart, Entrepreneurship, Accountability, Respect, Trust & Transparency) and we’re always looking for team players, with a point of view, a sense of humility and a let’s-get-stuff-done attitude.

Our scale up is at the intersection of a quirky startup where designers and machine learning specialists work on problems together to savvy commercial teams working with finance folks to invent new business models. #WhatWouldYouBuild

          Lead Data Scientist – Operations Research£100,000 - £120,000100% remote/ hybrid/ London
Unless this is the first job advert you’ve read, you’ll have noticed that a lot of companies use the job title ‘Lead Data Scientist’ to mean “one of our senior data scientists”. Read on and the job usually turns out to be overwhelmingly doing data science, day in, day out.
This job couldn’t be more different.
Here, you’ll play a true leadership role – it’s a genuine opportunity to lead a data science team, transform the company’s product and help to turn a successful start-up into a scale-up business.
Where you come in
You’ll join a business that’s established a market for its optimised work scheduling product – they help some of the world’s leading organisations to create work schedules that deliver measurable commercial value and give staff a better, fairer work-life balance.
They’ve secured multiple rounds of funding and built a great team. Now they’re ready to take their data science team to the next level – and that’s where you come in.
From a data science perspective, your role is to help make the product faster, more flexible, more scalable and applicable to a broader client base and problem set. Working at every stage of the data science pipeline – from gathering to performance testing – alongside some smart colleagues you’ll be solving complex, engaging optimisation problems within a large solution space. It’s a chance to employ your best thinking and delve deep into things like data optimisation, machine learning algorithms, AI, EPUs and TPUs.
Then there’s the leadership aspect of the role – and this is where you can make a huge difference.
You’ll be the subject matter expert, working closely with the CEO, CTO and colleagues in Product to shape the data science strategy and influence the long-term shape of the product. If you enjoy injecting ideas and suggesting fresh approaches, you’ll love the role.
You’ll hire, and develop a small, smart team of data scientists, mathematicians and engineers – a great chance to develop your team leadership skills and to communicate a vision to others.
You’ll help transform a positive real-world application that helps employers including NHS Trusts and high street stores to take the pain out of workforce management, save time and improve their people’s lives. You’re working for the greater good.
About the business
This is a successful, globally trusted, award-wining company with huge scope to really accelerate. The global workforce automation market is set to more than double to $9bn in 2022 – a strong tailwind for growth.
The leadership team really care about changing scheduling for good – and about their people. The culture is flexible, collaborative and caring. People are friendly, inquisitive, and smart. There’s a refreshing lack of egos, micromanagement or office politics. Communication from the senior team is clear and transparent – you’ll know exactly what’s expected of you and what you’re working towards.
As you’d expect, work life balance is a priority here. You’ll be empowered to work when and where it suits you – whether that’s in the London HQ, 100% remotely or a blend of the two. The company are happy to supply WeWork all-access membership plus a £250 WFH setup budget and all the hardware you need.
What you need
You don’t need scheduling, optimisation or labour modelling experience.
You do need plenty of experience of taking machine learning to market –you’ve probably evolved a product or supported productized data science work.
Personally, you’ve shown you’re smart and results-focused – someone who can communicate well, support other people towards a goal, and contribute to data science strategy.
Technically, you’re comfortable using open-source tools and probably have pretty much all of these on your CV:
A degree in a relevant fieldPython proficientDistributed cloud computing experienceConversant with the latest approaches to large-solution-space optimisation problems.Exposure to an Agile environment
Nice-to-haves include MLOps (in a cloud environment); AWS/Azure; machine learning tools/approaches.

          Who We Are

Our team is the first in the world to use autonomous vehicles on public roads using end-to-end deep learning, computer vision and reinforcement learning. Leveraging our multi-national world-class research team we're focusing on using data to learn more intelligent algorithms to bring autonomy for everyone, everywhere. We aim to be the future of self-driving cars, not vehicles that are told how to drive through hand-coded rules and maps, but ones which learn from experience and data.

We are a close knit team of researchers, engineers, scientists and more - some of us are straight out of school, others have worked on bleeding edge problems for some of the biggest tech companies on the planet - but we are all working together to solve autonomous driving.

FRD is also responsible for supporting the supervision of Securitisations and Regulatory Covered Bonds (structured finance).

There are five teams in the department who work closely together with lots of cross team working. This role involves using your data science and analysis skills to identify risks, trends and outlier firms allowing us to assess and mitigate harm at an early stage by improving our predictive capability and prioritisation.

What are the key responsibilities? 

The Data Science Associate in the department will be responsible for:

          Who we're looking for

The role is part of the Client Insight Unit – a business facing team focusing on delivering data insights to a diverse and global set of stakeholders across Distribution, Product & Marketing. In addition, the role holder will be a member of Schroders' wider Data Insights Community, a team of professional data scientists collaborating and working together across the organisation. As part of this the role holder will participate in data science knowledge sharing, and both contribute to and draw upon the expertise of the broader Schroders community of data professionals.

About Schroders

We're a global investment manager. We help institutions, intermediaries and individuals around the world invest money to meet their goals, fulfil their ambitions, and prepare for the future.

We have around 5,000 people on six continents. And we've been around for over 200 years, but keep adapting as society and technology changes. What doesn't change is our commitment to helping our clients, and society, prosper.

The base

We moved into our new HQ in the City of London in 2018. We're close to our clients, in the heart of the UK's financial centre. And we have everything we need to work flexibly.

The team

The Product and Marketing & Communications divisions partner with both our Investment and Distribution arms to deliver on two primary objectives: leading product strategy to ensure alignment with client needs and good governance; and to drive growth through the creation, execution and promotion of Schroders' investment products and solutions capabilities.

As a department we are looking to embed data into the centre of everything that we do and develop an ecosystem where data driven insights shape day to day decision making. This ranges from suggesting which investment strategies we need to monitor, develop and price up, to what content we need to write about and target through our digital channels.

The newly formed Product and Marketing Data Insights team is driving this agenda forward. The team uses data science skills with technologies to unlock the value in data for decision-making. This encompasses everything from running ad hoc research projects, to developing proof of concepts, building scalable, automated solutions, and integrating these into the day to day lives of the division.

What you'll do

This role will be part of the CIU Data Science team. This team was created about 2 years ago and has achieved great recognition and results in its short life, through having helped the business identify new prospects and reduce churn, thanks to creatively designed machine learning models and algorithms.

The Lead Data Scientist will engage with internal customers, understand their needs and deliver insights, recommendations and tools to shape their actions. This will involve the application of advanced analytical methodologies including predictive modelling, recommendation engines and statistical assessments on complex and often disjointed datasets, and the output will take the form of reports and presentations, or the development of prototypes and dashboards. This requires a blend of skills including programming, data analysis and statistics, as well as data-led story telling, communication and business expertise. Additionally, creative and innovative thinking, a proactive work ethic, attention to the finer details and the ability to challenge the status quo are also valuable traits.

You will work as part of a scrum team, together with Machine Learning engineers and analyst developers, so data sets can be onboarded for analysis, and models scaled and automated for implementation. You will also be in close collaboration with the rest of teams within the CIU, as we are all dedicated to providing the best possible outcomes for our internal customers, this ranges from ever-improving data quality and reporting, to state of the art CRM and Marketing systems, alongside ensuring value is derived from the tools through engagement and adoption by end users.

As a senior member of the team, you will be regularly leading consultative discussions with senior colleagues to understand their business questions and shape the planned work and outputs, as well as supporting and guiding analytical work being done by more junior members of the team. You will also be leading discussions with colleagues in the Technology teams to ensure we have the right tools and data sets to perform the analyses required.

You will have 2 lines of mentorship. Your line manager will be the Head of Client Data Science, providing you with day to day support and providing a clear picture of where most business value can be created. The areas of focus will be shaped by the Head of Product and Marketing Insights, who owns the oversight, prioritisation and roadmap of the function.

Responsibilities
 Delivery of both ad-hoc analysis requests from Product and Marketing stakeholders, as well as proactive value-add research delivered through reports, dashboards, presentations, etc. Exploration of new data sets to assess their value towards existing or future book of work Owning project design and end to end delivery Managing and mentoring junior data scientists Creation of self-service analytical tools and dashboards.

          Born on the steps of a Vegas hotel, we were always going to be troublemakers. We started from one belief: that small businesses deserved better.

Paymentsense Ltd was founded in 2009.

With financial success, an impressive trophy cabinet (The Sunday Times Tech Track, Inc 5000, Great Places To Work to name a few) and a culture to be proud of, we knew we had built something great. In 2019, with 85,000 customers while steadily onboarding 2,500 more each month, we knew our customers could be happier, so we ripped up the rule book. To become genuinely customer-first in our culture and thinking, we identified all our customers' pain points and created 'The Wall of Pain'. That's when we knew that to offer the best solutions, we needed to build a new product.

Enter, Dojo.

Dojo represents an enormous organisational shift; we had to restructure how we thought and did things. In a year since we officially launched Dojo, we've welcomed over 20,000 new customers, 500 new team members and called two brand new offices home. We've evolved into a dynamic, product-led business creating our own payments products, integrated card machines and transaction monitoring app. Here, we go home each day knowing we've made a difference —our industry-leading NPS score and 5-star Trustpilot rating tells us that!

At Dojo, we are curious, relentless and customer-obsessed. Our ambition is much greater than getting business owners paid. We're turning transactions into meaningful relationships with a set of tools and technology designed to empower businesses to thrive in the experience economy.

Enabled by technology, but powered by people.

As we enter our next growth phase and embark on another exciting shift towards a B2B2C model following the acquisition of queue-management system and consumer app, Walkup, we have a lot of work to do. Over the next year, the business will transform again as we steady the ship for multinational growth and product diversification. We're looking for people who can enhance our agility, ambition and risk-taking mentality while turning us into a well-oiled machine that's well-positioned to shape the experience economy.

          Do you want to work on the most pressing problem of our generation?

We're building the infrastructure for the net zero transition, and we're looking for brilliant engineers, designers, and data scientists who want to help define a low carbon future.

Decarbonizing the economy requires a granular, real-time view of where emissions come from and how they might be reduced. We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives. We were part of the Y Combinator Summer 2020 batch and have secured backing from the UK government's innovation arm, InnovateUK, the NatWest accelerator and the London Business School Incubator.

To join Carbon Chain, you'll be a keen technologist who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of 10 passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we've run Amazon's European supply chain, built JustEat's corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We've got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there's a lot we don't know, and we're hoping you can help fill that gap.

What will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?

As the world wakes up to the reality of climate change and the need to decarbonize, there's a pressing need to understand the carbon intensity of every activity in the economy. Your job as Data Scientist is to build the datasets, models, and pipelines we need to provide that understanding.

We're a small team of versatile technologists and we don't believe in a siloed approach. Our data scientists sit side by side with software engineers and designers, making sure that we have the data we need to provide the experience our customers want. You'll be deeply embedded in the product team, with your work being deployed to clients every week. You'll work closely with our domain experts, and have the chance to present to clients if that's something that excites you.

You can expect to have:
Ownership of your projectsAn independent path to productionThe ability to make real changes with tangible business value

Our data science stack is predominantly Python. We deploy our work in a variety of ways depending upon the challenge, from Lambdas to Docker containers. A typical service might pull together a mix of data from relational and non-relational databases, train a machine learning model nightly, and expose predictions via a Lambda function. We've got a huge number of exciting things to build, from interactive visualizations of industrial processes to fluid-dynamics models of shipping emissions.

Our only must-haves are possessing a hunger to solve business challenges using technology, the ability to build close relationships with your team, and the right to work in the UK.

Which tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?
Data processing with the standard scientific stack (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy) and beyondMachine learning in Sklearn and (rarely) Pytorch Data visualization with Plotly, Maptlotlib, and AltairContainerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.Object-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.PostgreSQL and DynamoDB managed databases form the persistence layer - you'll learn to navigate document and relational databases and appreciate the values in both worlds.Infrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mentality across the whole technology department (and beyond).Testing approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions.Quality assurance is owned by the team themselves - we believe that full cycle product ownership should sit tightly within the team.Agile development, using various approaches from Scrum to Elephant Carpaccio, helps us deliver software in small iterations, learning and course-correcting in the process to make sure we deliver the right improvements.GitHub PRs are an integral part of our core development flow - with reviews to help share knowledge and improve quality.Continuous delivery is the approach we strive for - with metrics that help us optimise parts of the pipeline that need it the most.Teamwork and collaboration are fundamental to the delivery of our solutions. We encourage solutionizing between the team and the wider business.

You don't need to be a pro at all of these skills to apply for the role, but we'd love to hear about any relevant knowledge and experiences that you have in these areas.

What we require from applicants
Right to work in the UK and willingness to come to London office 2+ days a week1+ years of commercial Data Science experienceA passion for environmental issuesA demonstrated interest in building products and collaborating tightly with engineersThe grit and energy to work in an early stage startup

What we're offering
Competitive salary + generous equity packageFlexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeingFlexible working location (we like to meet in the office couple of times every week)£1000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new thingsTech equipment of your choiceTeam lunch on Wednesdays, and frequent pub tripsPakt coffee and snacks of your choice in the office28 days holiday + bank holidays 

We're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.

The opportunity

Are you working on data science problems but worried that your solutions may never be productionized? Do you want exposure to clients across a range of different domains? Perhaps you're looking for new and exciting ways to apply your technical skills to make a positive impact. If you are keen to accelerate your career in data science and start working on unsolved, intellectually challenging business problems, then look no further.

Can you share a little more on some of Quantium’s projects?

At Quantium, we seek out complex, technical problems to solve. We leverage extremely large and often disparate datasets in the retail, FMCG / CPG and banking industries to solve problems for our clients that have never been solved previously. These include business problems like optimizing product offerings, personalizing customer interactions, pricing, selecting the best locations for stores/branches or improving inventory forecasting for some of the biggest companies in the world.

These will typically be end-to-end data science solutions, deploying complex models that underpin decision-engines our clients deploy. We work in fast-paced environments on transformational projects with tight timeframes, often teaming up in agile delivery squads. Our projects are diverse, and our solutions have a big impact on our clients’ businesses, shaping the direction of their industries and the experience of the customers they touch.

What will I be doing as a Data Scientist at Quantium?

Many things! Your role will likely evolve as we continue to grow but at its core, the Data Scientist is a technical role that delivers high quality end-to-end analytical support across multiple projects, as a member of a project team.

Working in small, cross-functional project teams, you will have lots of opportunity to learn from senior leaders and share your learning with the team too.

You've mentioned consulting work. Tell me more about the travel requirements.

Our team is committed to growing trusted relationships with our clients. For the current and upcoming projects, you may be required to work onsite at client offices for 50% of your time. We are happy to be creative with travel options to accommodate to individual needs and our teams are currently based in London and Leeds. Travel depends on where our clients are based, need to be on site and clients’ relative openness to remote work.

OK, this is all sounding great. But do you have a bullet point list so I can see if I meet the requirements of this opportunity?

Our consultants, product developers, business development specialists, operations professionals and more all bring something unique to Faculty, and you’ll learn something new from everyone you meet. You’ll also have the opportunity to make your mark on a high-growth start-up now poised to expand internationally.

Fostering talent is one of our core values, it’s built into our culture and what we offer. An incredible, unique learning and development system: Faculty was founded by people who are passionate about continuous learning, and adding value to our people. Genuinely flexible working: We believe people have needs, responsibilities and interests that require something different to a strict working day. We trust people to organise and take accountability for their own work and do our best to support their lives outside Faculty. Equity, we want you to benefit from Faculty’s growth and success.

644|United Kingdom|data scientist|Data Scientist, Causal Inference|Deliveroo|London, England, United Kingdom|2 weeks ago|161 applicants| |Full-time|Mid-Senior level|1,001-5,000 employees|Food and Beverage Services|"
          About the RoleAt Deliveroo we have a world-class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo and have strong relationships with our business partners.
Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data-driven decision making.
At Deliveroo we’re always experimenting. We have hungry customers, eager riders, and busy restaurants in 12 countries and over 200 cities and giving them what they want and need involves continually testing new ideas. Whether we’re working to improve our restaurant recommendations or looking to find a more efficient algorithm for routing our drivers, experimentation helps us make the right decisions for our users.
Experimenting at this scale presents some unique challenges and we’re investing heavily in building a world-class platform for designing, deploying, and analysing product experiments. We’re looking for experts in statistical inference and estimation to join our growing team of data scientists and help us develop innovative statistical solutions for industrial-scale experimentation.
Some of the problems we’re working to solve:How can we monitor possible interaction effects across our experiments? How can we account for such effects in the analysis of our experiments?How can we improve our inference techniques to correctly account for the many statistical tests we calculate? Once we have chosen such a correction, how can we account for it at the power calculation stage?How can statistical methods help us estimate the long-term impact of experiments?How can we leverage modern statistical algorithms in order to identify any business-relevant heterogeneity of treatment effects?How can we avoid running afoul the selection bias across the many experiments we run? Can we use shrinkage estimators to get closer to the actual impact of an experiment once rolled out?How can we use the outcomes of previous experiments to improve our inference for a given experiment?
Responsibilities:Investigating complex methodological problems and working collaboratively with a small team of experts to establish world-class standards for experimentation. Leveraging your broad statistical awareness to proactively identify opportunities to add to and improve our existing experimentation methodsPrototyping and amending statistical methods to fit our specific circumstancesPrototyping the code and providing clear communication and written documentation for the engineering team
Qualifications:PhD in statistics, economics, econometrics, or a relevant field of applied mathematicsBroad statistical awareness, including familiarity with frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and a demonstrated ability for developing innovative experimentation and analysis methodsFamiliarity with a scripting language, some proficiency with Python would be an asset
Data Science at DeliverooWe are a small team, with a very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we’re always looking for new ideas and we’re very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.
There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven’t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.
Benefits and DiversityAt Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.
We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest-growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.

Now they’re ready to take their data science team to the next level – and that’s where you come in.From a data science perspective, your role is to help make the product faster, more flexible, more scalable and applicable to a broader client base and problem set. Working at every stage of the data science pipeline – from gathering to performance testing – alongside some smart colleagues you’ll be solving complex, engaging optimisation problems within a large solution space. It’s a chance to employ your best thinking and delve deep into things like data optimisation, machine learning algorithms, AI, EPUs and TPUs.Then there’s the leadership aspect of the role – and this is where you can make a huge difference.You’ll be the subject matter expert, working closely with the CEO, CTO and colleagues in Product to shape the data science strategy and influence the long-term shape of the product. If you enjoy injecting ideas and suggesting fresh approaches, you’ll love the role.You’ll hire, and develop a small, smart team of data scientists, mathematicians and engineers – a great chance to develop your team leadership skills and to communicate a vision to others.You’ll help transform a positive real-world application that helps employers including NHS Trusts and high street stores to take the pain out of workforce management, save time and improve their people’s lives.

          If you could go back in time, you’d buy as much Bitcoin as you possible could wouldn’t you? Do you ever wish that you’d thought to buy a few thousand shares when Amazon or Apple or Tesla were in their early stages? Perhaps even the opportunity to have worked at one of those companies when they were still only a few hundred people. (Imagine the position you’d be in today!)

Well this could very well be THAT opportunity. An extremely attractive position has arisen to join a rapidly growing organisation who are already immensely successful and dominating in the new and exciting RegTech industry.

Having only been around for a short period of time, RegTech saw an explosion of investment in 2021 with investments totaling almost $19 billion globally, a 250% increase compared to 2020 and this growth isn’t slowing down.

The Company

As an early entrant into the world of RegTech, they have been able to successfully establish a solid foothold in the sector and consequently reaped the benefits of its immense growth. Over 200 people hired last year with ambitious growth plans for the future, $50 million in series C investment in 2020 and named top 100 fastest growing companies in Europe by the Financial Times, to name a few. This is a truly promising company and thus an exceptional time to join and grow alongside them.

The company have made a name for themselves by building the world’s largest knowledge graph of financial risk information by joining people, companies, sanctions lists, news articles, politically exposed people lists and many other sources together and by using AI and machine learning, will power the new generation of AML financial crime fighting products.

So, not only will you get to join a high growth company, on a highly competitive salary but you’ll also get to boast that you’re a real life super-hero fighting fraud and financial crime on a daily basis.

The Role

You’ll be leading their flagship data function who are a part of an x-functional agile team made up of Product Managers, Engineers, Machine Learning Engineers and fellow Data Scientists , working together to get models into production. You’ll get to work on a plethora of different, meaningful projects including; truth finding, link prediction, triple classification, graph inference, relation extraction and more.

You’ll also get exposure to a range of different industries within finance including Cryptocurrency, early stage start-ups, Insurance, WealthTech, Investments and more!

As a lead, you’ll also be mentoring and upskilling junior members while monitoring and offering your expertise to the more senior members of the team. Don’t be fooled though, this is still very much a hands-on technical position where you’ll get stuck into solving problems with your team to offer the best solutions possible. We want to make it very clear that we’re not looking for a manager. What we are looking for is an extremely technical individual who is capable of managing.

What’s Essential
Highly educated to at least a Masters level standard in a relevant or STEM based subjectExtensive experience working with Graph Inference and Graph Pattern ClassificationHighly technical and confident in your own coding ability, ideally in PythonAn expert in not only developing algorithms but also applying them to real-world problems
What’s In It For Me?

          The Company

Plum Guide is on a mission to build the definitive collection of the world's most remarkable home-stays. We are taking a systematic approach to vetting every single home on the planet and accepting only the top 3%. Like a Michelin Guide, but for homes. We do it by putting every home in a destination through a systematic vetting process, which includes identifying candidate homes through proprietary AI, interviewing hosts and sending our Home Critics to visit and test nominated homes in person.

We launched in 2016. Since then we have grown incredibly quickly; expanded to 345 locations in 29 countries; tested over 600,000 homes; and developed a customer experience that's returning the highest NPS scores in the industry.

About The Data Team

We are a small but high performing team who work with every team across the business as well as building our own projects. We are highly respected in the business and are getting ever-increasing responsibility for delivering new growth opportunities or finding efficiencies.

Some of the work done by the data team that we have written about:
CriticNet: Scaling the business with Deep Learning CriticNet: Scaling the business with Deep Learning — Part 2 

Plum Guide and the Data Team's focus for the next 12 months is on hyperscale and hypergrowth: taking Plum Guide truly global. This is where you come in.

The Role

We believe in creating the best experience for our guests and hosts while being able to move fast and operate at scale. This role will have a significant impact on improving our search experience as we move towards personalization and surfacing much richer data to our users.

We also want to be able to find the best homes and ensure they have accurate pricing so our guests know they are getting the best deal. We support this initiative by building sophisticated models to find homes, scraping data and combining it with our own data to price homes correctly.

This role will be in the Data team but there will be significant collaboration with the Product & Tech team to implement these solutions.

Responsibilities

One of the responsibilities of this role is to enable our Search to rank homes in the most optimal manner for a wide range of customer types. We want to be able to show each user the right types of homes at the right time in order to increase our chances of them buying. To do this we need to develop ranking and personalisation algorithms.

We intend to build some further machine learning models to improve our product and guest experience, this will be a portion of the job.

Additionally, there is some data engineering work that predominantly takes place in Google Cloud: This includes our ETL, airflow orchestration and scraping data.

For the above work, you will take ownership of nearly all aspects of the development process, from concept to development. Almost all our building of new products and deployment now occurs in Google Cloud, so you will have to be proficient in using Cloud technologies (or similar).

We are also very interested to explore your ideas and develop projects as you understand the business and our data. We definitely are at the beginning of an exciting and intellectually stimulating journey.

Finally, you will employ your skills to support the data team in other areas, such as:
General problem solving and idea generation for improved business performance and efficiencyPresent and communicate findings to stakeholders in compelling easy to grasp ways.

Working closely with the Head of Data and other experienced data scientists, you will be at the forefront of how analytics is used at Twinkl; tasked with ensuring that we derive the maximum value possible from our rich and varied datasets (over 10 trillion data points at the last count!).

Dependant on your interests and experience, you will work in one or more of the following data scientist teams:
 The Key Algorithms team: ensuring that every one of our key customer-facing algorithms (recommendations, internal search, etc) is providing the best possible website experience for every one of our customers. The Key Subscription Metrics team: making sure that our product helps as many customers as possible by maximising subscription uptake measures such as activation, retention, upgrade and winback rate. The Data Reporting Team: finding new ways to take data reporting to the next level and facilitate the entire business to make data-driven decisions. The Projects team: prioritising high value data-driven projects on an ad-hoc basis to ensure that our data assets are continuously being leveraged to add the highest level of value to the organisation.

In the data team how you achieve your task is 100% over to you: no one is going to be prescribing exactly what to do, or exactly how to do it (although you’ll have a strong network of experienced Data Scientists to help you out!). To be successful you’ll need to innovate, chat with key stakeholders, and read up on best practices in order to identify and implement the most appropriate data-led solution (see ‘ongoing projects’ below to see the exciting projects the current team are working on!)

You will find the data team regularly using SQL, Python, GA, Elasticsearch and BigQuery; as well as Jira and GSheets for project management. Depending on the challenge at hand, we also use Tableau for in-depth visualisations, and big data technologies to implement machine learning solutions that Python can’t handle. Don’t worry if you’ve not used all these techs before - we’re not necessarily looking for someone with lots of experience with these languages specifically, it’s an insatiable curiosity and innate ability to think logically that we’re most interested in.

Ongoing projects:
Leveraging our recommendation systems to preempt customer need and email them the teaching resources they need for the coming week, before they know they need them.Continuous collaboration with the conversion rate optimisation team to test and improve all touchpoints of the user experience in a data led progression.Blending traditional search engine logic (think TF-IDF) with cutting edge machine techniques in order to provide the best possible search experience.Using a hybrid collaborative-filtering approach to show the most relevant resource page recommendations on each of our 500 000 resource pages.Engineering data pipelines that analyse customer need in real-time to automatically flag (and address!) gaps in our product offering as soon as they arise.Visit our Data Science Blog to find out more 

To succeed in the role, you will:
Have a strong analytical mindset and relentless attention to detail.Have the ability to see projects through from conception to delivery, bringing actionable insight to bear.Have the ability to break down complex problems into manageable parts that can be actioned step by step.Have excellent communication skills, including being able to explain complicated concepts in layman’s terms.Be able to identify viable business opportunities that can be actioned using data

In this role, you will have the opportunity to:
Compose complex queries; pulling the information you need from our huge data sets (the biggest of which has more than a trillion data points!)Implement machine learning techniques using a flexible variety of tooling and programming languages.Work closely with senior leaders, experienced data scientists and a range of others across all levels of the organisation; partnering with them to deliver concrete results on a data led project. Attend in-house bi weekly training sessions, covering a range of key technical and soft skillsApply for one of our fully funded spaces on the part-time Developer Academy Data Science course (usually costs £5000)

You’ll work with:
George Mulroy (Head of Data) - George started his career as an infant school teacher before retraining as a Data Scientist (Sheffield Uni Data Science MSc). George now works as Twinkl’s Head of Data, as well as doing occasional contract Data Science Consultancy work.

          hackajob is a SaaS-enabled marketplace that allows companies to scale their tech teams today, whilst building their talent of tomorrow.

Technology is driving the world forward at an unprecedented rate. Every company has woken up to realise they need to place technology at the heart of their strategy or they’ll soon be extinct. And at its core, this transformation will be driven by great people.

But how great people and great companies find each other is broken. It’s opaque, biased and plagued by a terrible experience. And as the demand for technical talent explodes, not enough is being done to create the talent for tomorrow.

We're changing this with radical transparency, best-in-class service and a long-term approach to talent, all powered by technology.

We see a world where technical talent has an incredible experience developing their career and finding the right company to unleash their full potential, whilst employers are able to attract, nurture and retain the talent they need to thrive in the technical economy.

You thrive on working in a startup environment, which can be full of unpredictability and change, and enjoy the challenge of helping shape and grow something, making sense of the sometimes abstract

We’d especially love to hear from you if you:
are experienced working with enterprise SaaS products.have experience developing data modelling/analysis code in a modular, reusable fashion using modern software development techniques (e.g. test-driven development).have experience of statistical inference and probabilistic modelling.are familiar with the use of automated pipelines for building, deploying, monitoring and updating production machine learning models.have a good command of relational databases and SQL.have experience conducting and/or analysing consumer research trials or A/B tests.have a strong community involvement (open-source, conferences, meetups, etc).

          🤖 AI at CUBE

CUBE uses AI and NLP to machine read the regulatory internet, at global scale. We collect, clean, standardise, translate, monitor, classify, and enrich regulatory data across 180 countries in over 60 languages. All in near real-time.

We've even built our own ontology of regulation—machine-driven and continuously refined by a team of subject matter experts.

On a high level, CUBE uses AI to transform regulatory data into customer-specific regulatory intelligence. And this is exactly where RegBrain comes in.

🧠 RegBrain

It's always a great time to become a CUBER, but now literally could not be a better time. This year, we are expanding the core RegBrain team, having established our data and infrastructure foundations within GCP. You will not only lead the development from these foundations, but also play a critical role in the expansion of the team (we are aiming to double by the end of 2022).

CUBE has the world's most comprehensive corpus of regulatory content, and it has been collected, cleaned, standardised, translated, and classified by the RegTransform AI teams. The RegBrain team works with not only this structured (and enriched!) regulatory text, but also customer data from our core platform and 3rd party partners. No other team at CUBE has ever had ownership over all of this data.

🚀 The mission: to take CUBE's AI to the next level by a) creating the ultimate semantic map of global regulation and b) learning from the intersection of customer and regulatory data.

The RegBrain team is responsible for the end-to-end research, design, and development of both the semantic map and a suite of AI-driven capabilities—including recommendation systems, regulatory change prediction, and sentiment analysis.

🏗️ Core Responsibilities

As the lead data scientist / machine learning engineer, your main responsibility is to oversee the development and productionisation of ML and NLP prototypes. Your end products are APIs that can be consumed by CUBE's core platform or incorporated into CUBE's own API, RegConnect.
Determine the cloud architecture strategy and overall ML systems for RegBrain, guided by MLOps principles. All of our models must be scalable, monitored, and continuously improved. Lead—and expand—a team of data scientists and machine learning engineers. Mentorship and management are equally important.Guide the selection and development of optimal ML & NLP models for each RegBrain use case, leveraging SOTA approaches wherever appropriate (but also recognising when a simpler model is preferable).Improve the efficiency, performance, and scalability of ML & NLP models (this includes data quality, ingestion, loading, cleaning, and processing).Oversee the development and refinement of the semantic map (knowledge graph) of CUBE's regulatory data.Provide input for the RegBrain roadmap, working closely with the Head of Product.Provide input for data pipeline requirements, working closely with our data engineering team.Stay up-to-date with ML & NLP research, and experiment with new models and techniques.

💪 Core Requirements
Extensive experience with end-to-end model design and deployment within cloud environments (bonus points for GCP) ☁️Extensive experience with ML & DL platforms, frameworks, and libraries 📚Experience with and passion for MLOps best practises 🌀 Experience analysing vast volumes of textual data (almost all of our use cases will involve NLP) 🔠Strong familiarity with SQL and NoSQL/graph databases (bonus points for ArangoDB) 🏦Solid understanding of data structures, data modelling, and software architecture 🏛️Team management and mentorship experience 👩🏽‍🏫 Ability to write clear, robust, and testable code, especially in Python 🐍Strong grasp of data visualisation techniques (for dashboarding, reporting, etc.) 📊 A systems thinking approach 🌐A mathematically and statistically-oriented brain 🔢A healthy sense of humour (you're going to need it... don't say we didn't warn you 😉)

Experience matters. But what is more important than raw number of years of experience is demonstrated proficiency (through GitHub profiles/online portfolios and the interview process itself). Bonus points for Stack Overflow and Kaggle contributions! 💯

💝 Why you'll love RegBrain (& CUBE)

If there is a best time to join RegBrain, it's now. Here are the many reasons why.

🌍 Immediate global impact. CUBE is a well-established player in regtech (we were around before regtech was even a thing!), and our category-defining product is used by leading financial institutions around the world (including Revolut, Citi, and HSBC). We have an audience across 150 countries, and they love CUBE.

🗽 Freedom & flexibility. Think of RegBrain as a fully-funded startup within a scaleup. Over the past six months, we've only laid the basic foundations within GCP: you will have a significant influence over how we develop our tech stack and ML ways of working. To Airflow or not to Airflow? PyTorch or TensorFlow? You decide. As long as you can justify your choices, the rings of Saturn are the limit.

📊 Quantity & quality of data. The stage has literally been set: over the past 10 years, the five engineering teams at CUBE have built solid foundations for data collection, transformation, and classification. The RegBrain team focuses solely on learning from this mountain of structure.

🗣️ A rich & complex dataset. The main dataset is not only already structured, but also longitudinal and multilingual. We've tracked changes to regulation over time and built in-house translation models for 60+ languages.

📚 Always learning. Part of your job is to stay up-to-date with the latest research, and share your learning with the RegBrain team and other AI teams at CUBE. You'll have a training budget and a conference budget. In the mid-long term, we're aiming to collaborate with universities.

⚖️ Responsible AI. We will proactively address the inevitable biases that emerge for any AI system. Our Head of Product was trained at the Oxford Internet Institute and has direct connections with ethicists who are influencing the future of AI regulation.

💻 Employee-first work-life policy. CUBE went fully remote before the pandemic even hit, because we wanted to define the future of work. As a CUBER, you'll be able to design your home office and choose your own work equipment. Unable to work from home one week, or desperate for in-person interaction with colleagues? No problem—book a room in a coworking space.

🌱 Sustainable, customer-driven growth. We are a bootstrapped company funded by customers and strategic private investment. This means that growth is sustainable, and product development is very closely aligned with customer needs.

🌎 Visa sponsorship if required. We know every single nuance of Skilled Worker visas.

🦄 Extremely bespoke hiring process. At CUBE, we're trying to flip hiring on its head: the objective of the process is to create a personalised job description (and title). This page sets the general context. We'll collaboratively determine the best role for you, given your interests, CUBE's needs, and other members of the team.

⏱️ Hiring timeline

We know how insufferably long and complicated hiring processes can be. We've been there before.

That's why at CUBE, we aim to compress the hiring timeline to between 10 and 15 days (from the first-round interview to the final round). There's no HR screen, culture fit interview, or coding on a whiteboard. Just high-quality infoflow in both directions. 🌊

Here's what will happen:
Online application (link below 👇)First round video interview with RegAI's Head of Product (30-45m)Second round video interview with the CTO of RegPlatform (30-45m)Take-home challenge (it'll be fun, we promise, and we won't ask for more than a few hours of your time)Final round panel interview, again over video, with product, data science, and engineering representatives (60-90m)

If you have any questions at this stage, feel free to use the live chat widget on this page. Otherwise: what are you waiting for? This is your once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to define the future of regulation. The clock is already ticking. 🕰️

          The Trade Desk is a global technology company with a mission to create a better, more open internet for everyone through principled, intelligent advertising. Handling over 600 billion queries per day (more than 100 times the query volume of search globally), our platform operates at an unprecedented scale. We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, ownership, empathy, and collaboration. We value the unique experiences and perspectives that each person brings to The Trade Desk, and we are committed to fostering inclusive spaces where everyone can bring their authentic selves to work every day.

Do you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a dynamic, globally-connected team where your contributions will make a meaningful difference in building a better media ecosystem? Come and see why Fortune magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among the best small-medium-sized workplaces globally.

About the role:

Staff Data Scientists serve both as technical individual contributors and people managers. You will be responsible for owning a technical area as well as building and nurturing a team.  Staff Data Scientists are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, researching, building, and delivering data-focused products for our clients.  Our Data Science team is embedded into nearly a dozen individual, mission-focused engineering teams working across a wide spectrum of technological and scientific challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and background, to own problems related to natural language processing and machine learning over hundreds of millions of web pages, graph mining and algorithmic optimization on petabytes of data, and causal inference with missing data - to name a few. Staff Data Scientists contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and direct people-management, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them. 

Who we are looking for:

You have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful machine learning projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing. You are a driver. You will be driving technical projects and providing leadership in a ground-breaking and fast-paced environment. This includes task planning and conducting code reviews, as well as individual code contribution. You have a strong sense of data intuition. At our scale, many off-the-shelf modeling techniques (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles and intuition to develop solutions and adapt them to a unique environment. You are a broadly skilled data scientist with experience embedding models into always-on production systems, working across a variety of technologies and data sources. You have a product-focused mindset. You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making. You work with confidence and without ego. Our data scientists have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates. You value, seek out, and foster diversity. We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground. You are a creative thinker, not bound by ""the way things have always been done."" What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need data scientists who know all the answers; we need data scientists who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked. 

What you bring to the table:

You have an abundance of intellectual curiosity and are enthusiastic to learn (and teach) new technologies / techniques. You are you comfortable working on an agile, distributed team spanning multiple time zones and continents. You are able to communicate effectively across both technical and non-technical audiences. You have 8+ years of experience working in a data-driven role, including leading large and impactful technical projects. You may have an advanced degree in a quantitative field, but it’s not a requirement. What and how you can contribute is what’s most important to us which is why our consideration is not limited by the level of education you have. You have experience with big data technologies such as Spark or AWS; are able to write efficient SQL; and are proficient in one or more of the following programming languages: R, Python, Java, or Scala. Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as a data scientist though which is why we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start. What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job. 

As our Data Science AI Lab grows, you can become a valuable member if:

You have a track record of turning the latest AI publications into solutions for exotic real world problems or ideas for novel product creation. You have strong programming and big data processing skills, with experience of making machine learning or data mining algorithms work on massive amount of data. Extensive hands-on experiences of Deep Learning and its different applications would be a plus. 

The Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is an equal opportunity employer. All aspects of employment will be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, marital status, age, national origin, ancestry, physical or mental disability, medical condition, pregnancy, genetic information, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, veteran status, or any other status protected under federal, state, or local law.

          Principal Machine Learning Data Scientist required to join a genuine powerhouse in their impressive Edinburgh City Centre office. You will be working on developing world-class products and services in a hugely innovative environment.

The Company

A global Software House who have been at the forefront of their industry for decades; developing new emerging technology; implementing market changing infrastructure and being early adopters/ drivers of new IT systems/technology.

Innovation is key to everything they do, and you will have a lot of autonomy to build cutting edge technology and platforms that will impact people on a global scale. They are currently recruiting for Data Scientist's in multiple teams across the office, however, no matter what team you join, I can guarantee you'll be working on really interesting stuff, using modern technology and state-of-the-art kit.

The Role

You will be involved in designing, building and evaluating machine learning systems in order to solve a plethora of business problems. As previously mentioned, you will be working for one of a number of different teams who are all working on slightly different problems. However, the end goal for all of them is to deliver a better service for the customers - this rings true throughout the organisation, from the top down.

They are also developing world-leading internal products, with the aim to streamline business processes through the work of Data Science and specifically machine learning. It almost goes without saying but you will have access to a vast amount of data. However, unlike some organisations you will be set up for success from day one. They have the correct processes and technology in place and don't expect you to find the data, extract it, clean it up and then start building models. You'll be working with likeminded people, building real models which will actually be put into production!

You

You will have a strong background in Data Science and a large amount of that time will have been spent, focusing on building machine learning models, either academically or commercially.

You will likely have a few years commercial experience under your belt as a Data Scientist or be a proven academic, applying data science techniques to your chosen field. Although not a necessity, the leadership team would be delighted if you had a PhD in a relevant field such as Computer Science, Physics, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Software Engineering, Bioinformatics, Applied Mathematics, Pure Mathematics or equivalent.

You will be eager to work in a fast-paced environment, utilising modern tools, processes and techniques, working alongside genuinely top-drawer colleagues. You will be a true innovator - transforming complex problems into products the world hasn't seen or potentially know they even need! Although there are not line management responsibilities, you may be coming from a Data Science Team Lead, CTO or Senior Data Scientist background.

Package & Office/Location:

You can expect all the perks of a modern software company, including: a stunning custom-built office in the city centre, breakout rooms, free food & drink, pool tables, regular social events, top of the range kit and a very flexible approach to working hours and indeed, work life balance.

The package on offer is genuinely one of the best available in the UK, never mind Edinburgh. We are able to offer a base salary in the region of £70-150k depending on your experience/skills, as well as a bonus, share options and flexible benefits including private healthcare.

This is, without exaggeration or hyperbole, one of the most unique opportunities in Scotland available right now and if you are a Data Scientist keen to make your mark in a world leading company, get in touch with Hamish Niven at Cathcart Associates for a more detailed conversation.

          The Company

This highly successful strategy consultancy specialise in the government and defence sectors.

They have significant innovation funding from the MoD, meaning that they don’t just pitch an idea to improve what’s in place but actually have to prove that something has never been done before and is genuinely different to anything or anyone else.

The Role

Your role would be to develop and design decision aid tools and models to carry out analysis for customers and more recently, there has been an increased focus on product development. The content of decision aids, used for strategic or operational decision making, is predominantly AI based machine learning and there are a range of unique techniques developed internally.

A niche but exciting area they work in is explainable AI, which is a part of past, current projects and future plans. Given that clients are typically within the defence sector, when machine learning algorithms spit out an answer, it’s not possible to simply rely on the computer saying this is what you should do. It’s essential to add reasons why, which is challenging to generate from standard ML algorithms.

The Individual
Three years’ or more of experience in data science.Strong Python proficiency.Excellent communication skills, both verbal and written.To acquire security clearance, it’s a necessity that you have lived in the UK for five consecutive years without spending more than three consecutive months out of the UK.

General System - About Us

Our mission is to transform the way humans and machines understand the world. In real-time. Enhancing human ingenuity, innovation, and safety in a sustainable manner.

We are doing this by creating a real-time index of reality, enabling billions of machines and trillions of sensors to land, index, share and consume each other’s data about the world as they move through it.

This is possible because we have created a unique new form of data processing. One that can process the volume, velocity, and breadth of data from millions of dynamic machines and sensors in its full fidelity. On as little as a single server. Processing that can collaborate and live anywhere.

This processing and our approach are unrelated to anything else in existence today.

Using the General System platform, your car will be able share what it sees with other cars. Your AR glasses will be able to query the world around them and access the information from millions of others. Your drone delivery will be completed quicker and safer. Your city will keep you safe. Our industries and supply chains will be more efficient. Our climate will be monitored.

Combined, the data from all of this will enable humanity to query reality and unlock new societal and economic outcomes. All while ensuring data dignity, privacy and control.

A team of 50+, we have contracts with some of the world’s toughest customers.
