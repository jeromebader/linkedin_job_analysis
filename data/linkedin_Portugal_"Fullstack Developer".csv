#MuchMoreThanJustAJobEarly morning. Campo 24 de Agosto. In 4 minutes, you are clocking in at the office. After grabbing a cup of coffee and fresh fruit, pick up your laptop and choose your spot for the day. It's going to be a busy one: French class before lunch and, just after, quick medical appointment at Natixis doctor's office.Lunch break. Outside in the big terrace (look at your crops at the Urban Garden; ready to harvest!) or, if you feel like stretching your legs, walk downtown to grab lunch.Back inside. Quick sprint review (working together anywhere means virtual happy birthday to that colleague in Paris that just turned 35). The afternoon went flying (tasks, reports, calls, some jokes with your teammates). End it on a high note: just one PlayStation game or the final match for that ping-pong tournament.Tomorrow, you complete that certified technical training and the day after, you will work from home, taking advantage to finally do that online course on Udemy. Once you are done with your tasks for the day, you can visit the office for a board games session or show up at the rehearsal of one of Natixis bands. If that is too steady for you, meet your colleagues to surf some waves or join them in a football match.

          The time to change is now! 
It's time to build a sustainable future and define how we evolve through technology with purpose.

At Lisbon Tech Hub we create value in the business digital transition, from Portugal to the world, and IT solutions with purpose. Our team has more than 1300 experts working in areas such as Analytics & Business Intelligence, Application Lifecycle Management, Cybersecurity, IT Infrastructure Management, IT Project & Service Management and IT Strategy & User Experience.

Transforming our future starts with every day!

Lisbon Tech Hub is the [1] home of the new technologists - Dream Builders, Impact Creators & Future Makers. 
Are you one of them? Join us!

What role will you play?

 * First and foremost, you love writing software. Your code is comprehensible, well-structured, highly performant; your best days at work are in front of the computer cranking out code on your own, although you have the experience to know that a winning product requires an entire team.
 * You are curious and passionate about knowing ""why"", whether it is why a use case is important for a customer, or why something strange happens one time in a hundred tries.
 * You love both learning and teaching. In this role, you will be interfacing with design, front-end, back-end, platforms, data science, as well as our PM; towards that end, you enjoy working across teams to solve hard problems.
 * Agile development is second nature. Not only will you be expected to participate in daily scrums, sprint planning, and retros; you'll be expected to help improve our ceremonies.
 * You strive for quality, and are obsessed with unit tests, automation, and squashing any bugs that sneak through. But it's more than that: you'll use our product, realize ""hey! that's not what I expected!"" and figure out how to make it better for everyone.

We are looking for:

 * Deep knowledge of at least one modern programming language (Java and/or Python preferred)
 * Expertise in service-oriented architectures; ideally, you've developed APIs for both internal and external-facing services
 * You're obsessed with performance, and have experience with instrumentation and monitoring services to ensure the application is behaving as expected
 * You have a basic knowledge of computer science fundamentals, including data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented design
 * 5+ years of industry experience developing large-scale applications (Junior candidates are also invited to apply!)

 * Experience with data processing technologies such as Kafka/Kinesis, Spark, Storm
 * Experience with Django, or similar server framework, or with Java microservice frameworks like Spring Boot or Quarkus
 * Ability to define, design and deliver a distributed automation platform for compute, storage, database, queuing and other infrastructure
 * Understanding of web service development
 * Understanding of micro services development
 * Knowledge of multi-tier architectures across multiple technology stacks .net, Java, J2EE, web servers, caching, application servers, RDBMS/NoSQL: Postgres, Dynamo DB

 * Experience building complex, scalable, high-performance software systems that have been successfully delivered to customers
 * Experience designing and deploying dynamically scalable, highly available, fault tolerant and reliable cloud applications (AWS preferred)
 * Experience with Cordova, Android, iOS development
 * Experience working with third-party / IoT integrations
 * Experience working with platforms for Big Data or Machine Learning solutions
 * Experience in working a full Agile team
 * Technologies We Use: Python, Java, Javascript, Typescript, Fast.io, Quarkus, Vue, React Native, Kotlin, Redis, Postgres, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, AWS, GCP, Azure
 * Strong verbal and written communication skills in English are a must

What we have to offer:
A flexible home office and schedule policy, virtual budget to improve your home office setup, health insurance, a Pension Plan and a Siemens Share Program time and financial support to your studies, medical center in the facilities, sport groups, 2 days for volunteering initiatives and a cool and relaxed environment. 
Access to e-learning platforms (Learnlight, Bookboon, Linkedin Learning and more), discounts with partners.

#Siemens #LXTechHub #ITMakesUsMove

#MuchMoreThanJustAJobEarly morning. Campo 24 de Agosto. In 4 minutes, you are clocking in at the office. After grabbing a cup of coffee and fresh fruit, pick up your laptop and choose your spot for the day. It's going to be a busy one: French class before lunch and, just after, quick medical appointment at Natixis doctor's office.Lunch break. Outside in the big terrace (look at your crops at the Urban Garden; ready to harvest!) or, if you feel like stretching your legs, walk downtown to grab lunch.Back inside. Quick sprint review (working together anywhere means virtual happy birthday to that colleague in Paris that just turned 35). The afternoon went flying (tasks, reports, calls, some jokes with your teammates). End it on a high note: just one PlayStation game or the final match for that ping-pong tournament.Tomorrow, you complete that certified technical training and the day after, you will work from home, taking advantage to finally do that online course on Udemy. Once you are done with your tasks for the day, you can visit the office for a board games session or show up at the rehearsal of one of Natixis bands. If that is too steady for you, meet your colleagues to surf some waves or join them in a football match.

We believe that local businesses are essential to any growing society. SaltPay was founded in 2019 to create affordable, fast and secure payments and software solutions to help small and medium-sized businesses manage and grow their operations better.

We're outcome-driven entrepreneurs who emphasise energy over experience. Our number one priority is to deliver solutions that will allow our local businesses to thrive.
