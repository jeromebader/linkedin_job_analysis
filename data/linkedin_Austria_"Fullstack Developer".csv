          Looking for a new job? We are expanding our team and are looking for a Flutter and React Developer to join us.

At TheVentury, we are passionate about innovation, technology and the positive change these can create. We bring brilliant minds together to provide lean & hands-on services in innovation management, data & software engineering and growth marketing to startups and corporates along the whole journey from idea generation to global impact.

Do you want to work with major European brands, as well as incredibly cool startups from around the world? Would you like to support the development of a team working on the bleeding edge of technology?

Then join our wonderful team of developers, growth marketers, innovators, nerds and crazies!

What you will be doing:

You will be part of an E.P.I.C. team working on different and exciting projects. We believe that you are capable to decide when and which tasks should be completed.

To understand the scope, here are some insights:
interacting with client's users and owning feature development along the entire stacklearning/educating through Merge Reviews/Pair Programming/Agile Ceremonies and market experimentsplanning the workload together with the team (in case of being a lead developer on a project)supporting people to grow What makes you the right fit:

At TheVentury, the main stack we work with on projects is a combination of:
Frontend: Flutter, ReactBackend: PHP, NodeJSDatabase: mostly mySQL/Maria, but also PostgreSQLDevOps: GitLab CI/CD, Kubernetes (AWS+GC)
Of course we don't expect you to know everything from that list. For the start we would like to find somebody who has solid experience in Flutter & React.

Anything in the above mentioned stack that you can already do is a big plus.

Some other parameters we are looking for: at least 3 years of experience working on multiple projectsmin. 1 year in Flutter, min. 2 years in Reacta strong self-learning hacker mind-set OR solid technical educationexperience in working with agile frameworks such as Scrumeagerness to share your knowledge and become a mentor for others
What we want you to learn:

We know that barely anyone can juggle the entire stack - it is broad after all!

However, education is dear to us! Sharing knowledge and expanding skills is part of getting ready for missions (i.e. projects). So, over time you will be able to tackle different areas and transition into a Fullstack developer.

Let us know during the interview what parts of the stack you are an expert in and what parts you would like to know more about. We see it as our mission to then empower you in learning the rest.

At TheVentury you will be working with a dynamic and diverse team of Marketers, Data & Software Engineers and Innovation Managers. You will be welcomed to bring your ideas to the table and encouraged to voice your opinion.

If you have a “yes – can do” attitude, then you should definitely apply.

Salary: According to the collective agreement, the minimum gross salary can be €45,000 per year. The actual salary may be higher depending on experience and qualification.
