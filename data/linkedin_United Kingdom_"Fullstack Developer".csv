          Hey there stranger 👋

We know that this is a looong ad and that you are super busy, so we made a video for you and below you have a TL:DR if you don't feel like reading. 😉

TL:DR

🎬 We are making the future and changing everything we think we know about video production

📌 The role is remote in European time zones, or on-site from our offices in several locations

⚒ FE: JavaScript - React.js, HTML5/CSS3; BE: Python (Flask), Node.js, C++; Infrastructure: Docker, AWS (Lambda, Fargate, EC2, EKS); DB: Postgres, MongoDB;

👩‍💻 We need senior software engineers that would help us with the development of new features our customers need to have a smooth user experience.

💶 70-100k € brutto yearly + stock options - ATM we are putting talent over money though

🦄 We finished the year with a 50 million € Series B investment, so we will not turn off anytime soon.

⬇ Bellow, you find much more info and the apply button ✅

Who Are We

Synthesia is the global leader in synthetic media. We are building the world's first video production studio - in a browser. As in, no cameras or film crews at all. You simply choose an avatar, enter your script in one of 60 languages, and your video is ready in minutes.

Here is how our Synthesia STUDIO looks like today:

About The Position

In this position, you'll join our small (around 10) and extremely talented product team. You'll have a chance to work on scaling our current, fast-growing product and shape some of the next products in our pipeline.

Some of the projects our backend engineers work on include building out a custom video/audio rendering pipeline, implementing real-time collaboration/editing, optimizing video delivery/streaming, solving scalability problems, etc.

Requirements
You ideally have a minimum of 5+ years of experience working on backend You have experience creating and maintaining large-scale solutions, preferably SaaS You are very pragmatic in your approach and you don't over-engineer You have the experience that ranges from early-stage start-ups to bigger, well-established organizations You are on board to work in our stack You know your distributed systems and are in this profession to solve complex technological problems You have strong CS fundamentals Experience with video rendering/streaming, optimizations for low-latency, or real-time editing (understanding concepts like OTs, CRDTs, etc.) is a huge plus Good level of spoken and written English is required 

How We Work

We have a fast yet non-hacky development style. We work strictly with product managers who have a technical background. As a result, we do not overwhelm engineers with unrealistic expectations/requirements, and we can therefore move forward much faster. Well, we don't have unrealistic expectations/requirements in the first place, since we see our roadmap as a set of high-level goals and we have no fixed timelines on deploying features - we want to get things to production as fast as possible.We do that by pushing features behind a feature flag - so not all users see all features, but our production is always updated. This brings zero-downtime deployments, backward compatible features, and similar challenges since our users should never be impacted.We follow SCRUM loosely - our engineers have one sync meeting per week, async text Slack dailies, we have no dedicated QA people, we work in super small & independent teams, we have no Jira and in our team, we only have engineers, no code monkeys.

For us, it's simple: give people time to do deep work. And help specify features that are limited in scope while discouraging hacky workarounds.

It's early for us and we don't know how right we are yet. But after two years of building our product team and core engineering principles, we can see that we are on the right track. Progress over perfection.

Working for Synthesia means working independently, making technical decisions and being responsible for them, being enabled and involved in the whole process of SDLC, and most importantly, putting arguments over ego. 😏

Urban Marovt, Fullstack developer @ Synthesia

Our stack & some context

We started to work on our main product - Synthesia STUDIO - almost two years ago with a very small team of engineers (BE and FS). We now have a functional MVP, that we develop, push forward and improve constantly but on the other hand, we have 3000+ daily users, and last year alone we generated 6+ million videos. 🤯 While we know, we have a long way to go, to bring our product to where we want it to be, we also have to be mindful of our existing userbase, which is also really involved with us and provides great feedback for each update and new feature we roll out.We have a lot of custom components and multiple layers of complexity, our product is constantly changing but if we try to sum up our stack:
Frontend is JavaScript/HTML/CSS using React.js + Redux; Backend is a mix of Python, Flask, Node.js, and C++ components that are mostly containerized with Docker, and hosted on a number of AWS services (Lambda, Fargate, EC2, EKS) We have a dedicated DevOps Engineer. 

The good stuff...

In addition to being a part of a great team, working in a fun and innovative environment, we offer...

📌Remote in Europe or work from our offices in London, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Munich, Ljubljana or New York

📈Generous stock option plan

💰Performance based bonus

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
 What is the hiring process?

We want to offer you a fast, smooth hiring process that also gives you a fair chance to get to know us and get all the information you may need, to make an informed decision.

This is our current process:
📢 First stage: a screening call with Sara, our tech recruiter, to check your level of English, if the info written in the CV is accurate, and to give you a first insight into our company (30 min)Second stage: a call with Gregor, Head of Product and Engineering. Gregor does a more in-depth tech screening but also gives you more information on how we engineer things (30 min)Take-home assignment: we have a challenge for you to show us how you approach things (we don't want you to spend more than a day on this)Tech call: a call with someone from the engineering team to go through the challenge with you (to see, if you have coded it yourself, to give you time to elaborate and to provide feedback) (60 min)Meet the team/founders: on this call, you usually meet one of the founders or people from the team and get a high-level understanding of where we are headed next (30 min)References: We ask you to provide 3 references.

We usually make the offer at this point and all the calls that come after this are for you - to clarify any questions, to talk details about working arrangements, salary negations, and so on. If we are all quick about every step, we can be done in 10-14 days.
 Where is Synthesia based?

We are a remote-first company with offices in several locations in Europe and US: London, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Ljubljana, Munich, and New York but we also have a bunch of engineers working remotely from other locations (Sweden, Croatia, India,...). If you join us you can either work remotely from Europe (GMT 0 +/- 2), from any of the offices or if you're not in any of these cities we can pay for a seat in a co-working space if needed.
 Do we hire regardless of location?

Due to time zone convenience and operational complexity, we prefer candidates that work from European countries. We are in a privileged position to put talent over passports, so we can sponsor visas and help with relocation but only if your profile is exactly what we are looking for.
 When was Synthesia founded?

Synthesia was founded in 2017 by a team of researchers and entrepreneurs from UCL, Stanford, TUM, and Oxford University. Notably one of the co-founders of the company is behind some of the most well-recognized research projects in the field, Deep Video Portraits, and Face2Face. The founding team members are:
Victor Riparbelli - CEOSteffen Tjerrild - CFO/COOProf Matthias NiessnerProf Lourdes Agapito Who are our investors?

Initial funding came from Mark Cuban and further investment was led by LDV Capital, joined by new investors MMC Ventures, Seedcamp, Martin Varsavsky's VAS Ventures, TransferWise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus, Tiny VC, and advertising executive Nigel Morris.

In Series B we raised $50 million led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Google Ventures and existing investors Firstmark Capital, LDV Capital, Seedcamp and MMC Ventures.
 What's the culture like and what are our principles?

At Synthesia we're passionate about building. Not talking, planning, or politicising. We strive to hire the smartest, kindest, and most unrelenting people and let them do their best work without distractions.

Our work principles serve as our charter for how we make decisions, give feedback, and structure our work to empower everyone to go as fast as possible.
Long term thinking; short term execution 🙇‍♂️ We think in quarters, years, and decades. But we embrace that the path will take unpredictable twists and turns. We avoid both futile planning and directionless execution.Outcomes over Inputs & Plans 🚢 We value outcomes and iterations, not inputs. We keep planning and process work to a minimum and seek to reduce coordination costs and perfectionism in favor of velocity.Be an Owner 🤴🏼 Acting like an owner is encouraged: asking questions, challenging decisions and showing leadership as long as it's constructive. Career paths are forged by actions and ownership.Make the Journey Fun 🤪 What's the point if we're not having fun? We strive for an informal, low hierarchy culture where we can all be our true selves.Default to Simple 🧶Simple is better - until it's not. But in most cases, we can stick to very simple solutions until we've proven that it's working and there is a need for a more robust and sophisticated solution.Radical Candor 🤡 Shying away from giving honest feedback is detrimental to excellence. We pride ourselves on being candid in a kind and compassionate manner. What's the work/life balance like at Synthesia?

We don't have any mandated core hours and in line with our culture, we trust our co-workers to be adult professionals that will do their jobs. We have a standard 40 hours workweek, with flexible working time. Most of us being located in the same time zone makes it easier for us to synchronize but we encourage asynchronous communication whenever possible so people can focus with the least amount of interruptions. We are a diverse group of professionals, from singles, youngsters, middle-aged couples to parents with kids of all ages. We are trying to make it work for everyone, to empower everyone to be a productive member of the team while hustling challenges life throws at all of us.

          At Deskpro, we make helpdesk software and we have customers of all shapes and sizes from across the globe, including Vodafone, Microsoft, NHS, and Panasonic. Deskpro is a large product with a large variety of features and modules, from email, chat, and voice, to blog posts, knowledgebase, and guides, and everything in between. There's always something new to build.

We have a Wimbledon office but remote opportunities are available for UK-based candidates who can't commute in.

View our careers page

What You Will Do As a Fullstack Engineer

As a fullstack engineer, you will help build new features and modules, you'll be involved in shaping our underlying product frameworks and our internal processes like code reviews and deployment, and you'll get to participate in feature planning and have real input on the direction we take the product and the company as a whole.

You'll be joining a small team where your specific experience will have great impact. You will have a lot of autonomy over your own projects and you will get to use your expertise to lead by example.

Deskpro is a small company, and that means you will sometimes be expected to dip in and out of various roles as needs arise. You will learn a lot through the varied work, and you will get satisfaction in shipping software that gets used by thousands.

Technology we use and where we're going

Most of the Deskpro product backend is written in PHP (Symfony, Laravel) with the primary data store being MySQL. The frontend is Typescript/React (with our own component library) and our primary APIs are GraphQL.

Most of our cloud services we run, such as internal services and our telephony product, are written in Typescript/Node and run on AWS either serverless or dockerized. But we use lots of other technologies like Elastic, Redis, and services offered by AWS like DynamoDB . We even have tools and services written in Kotlin and Go. We're big fans of using the right tool for the job!

Why should you be interested?
You'll get to use and learn about many different products, APIs and technologies. Deskpro is the central hub for a lot of companies, and we're always adding new features and modules and integrations.You'll get to work with real customers and get a peek into how other businesses operate.You'll get to learn about scaling software as well as scaling the SaaS platform as a whole.You'll get to try out new technology. We are constantly updating our stack and are always on the lookout for tools that will help us be more productive.

You are a good fit for the role if...
You have an earnest interest in developing software with a desire to learn more about the craft.You have a lot of experience with PHP (with Symfony or Laravel), but you are not married to PHP. You will be expected to pick up new technology and stacks where necessary. The best tool for the job is not always PHP.You've got experience on the frontend with ReactJS (ideally Typescript too) and want to do more.You have excellent written and verbal communication skills. We are big believers in ""writing stuff up"", everything from spec's to dev docs to RFC's. You need to be able to know your audience and communicate clearly.You enjoy solving problems yourself and like working in a ""get stuff done"" environment. We're a small team and we all generally just get on with things in a fairly autonomous manner. You won't be micro-managed.

Examples of projects we've been working on lately
Voice -- Incoming and outgoing calling from the browser, including features likes automated call routing and simple IVRs.AWS -- Moving all our infrastructure to AWS. This has included some ambitious projects like re-writing the email parser to make it more efficient.Reports -- New reporting system with dashboards, scheduled reports, and sharing.Apps platform -- A platform that allows third-parties to create ""apps"" that run within Deskpro.Filtering and search -- New filtering and search system to improve efficiency, accuracy, and UX.Social / Multi-channel messaging -- we are building out generic data structures with flexible ingress APIs to allow connecting Deskpro to any messaging channel including social sites like Twitter and Facebook, but we also envision integrations with systems like eBay messages or Apple/Google app stores. We'll be able to process any kind of communication.New GraphQL API backends.

And we have a lot more projects coming up including social integrations (Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, etc), asset tracking, approvals, and so much more.

Requirements
Strong experience building web apps with PHP and Symfony and/or Laravel. Our main product is written in PHP.Experience building SPA's with React. Typescript is a bonus.Experience with server-side Javascript/NodeJS is a bonus so you could jump right into other areas of the business such as our cloud platform.Strong experience with MySQL.Experience with AWS is a bonus.You should be a fast learner. We often venture into unknown territory so you should be a Google-fu master and have experience-driven intuition.You should be excited to dive deep into new technology and new programming languages. We're always happy to try new things if it'll help us ship better software.You should have a strong understanding of software architecture with opinions on ""the right way"" to do things.You should be a ""do-er"". You will have a lot of autonomy over your own work, and you will be expected to work with the team to make sure your projects get shipped.You work well with others and enjoy sharing your knowledge and leading by example.You should love the colour green. We're putting a big focus on delivering well-tested and super solid software!

Benefits
Competitive Salary (40-80k) + Share OptionsVaried work. Both in terms of what product features you will be working on, but you'll also have the opportunity to immerse yourself in other aspects of the company such as product planning, customer support, etc.A mixture of autonomy over your own work and real responsibilities to the team and business.Your choice of equipment (most of our devs like Macbook's with two 4k monitors).We encourage self-improvement: Company-sponsored server/hosting for your side projects; books; conferences; courses.

          Senior Fullstack .NET C# Developer Job Description

Who are you?

We are on the lookout for a Senior .NET C# Developer to join our expanding team. You will be a core member of the team delivering new functionality for our products, continuously improving our tech stack, and mentoring more junior members of the team. You will be involved in all aspects from designing technical approaches to problems, shifting more and more code to Azure cloud services to testing out the latest release of .NET Core.

OK, that’s me, but who are you?

DrDoctor is a HealthTech company on an exciting growth trajectory. Our technology focuses on engaging patients across their healthcare journey while saving hospitals time, effort and money.

Our Mission is that healthcare needs a reset. More people need care every day and health services struggle. Current patient engagement is a mess of disparate systems that hinder, rather than help care delivery.

Our Vision is a remote-first healthcare system, which can meet demand without sacrificing care quality. We want patients to be engaged in their care, shifting to a digital first model. We do that on scale:
10 million+ patients use DrDoctor We manage over 50 million appointments We work with over 40 NHS Trusts and Health Boards

Tell me more! Who will I be working with?

In this role you really will interact with every part of the business, even as we grow. But meet Anup...

Hi, I'm Anup, and I've been at DrDoctor for 6 years. I joined when there were just 6 people. It’s been an amazing experience so far. Everyone is super friendly, helpful and open, right from the top down. 

The work is great; it is something that has a real impact on people's lives and the NHS. And you are not pigeon-holed into one area; I find myself involved in anything from how we self-organise, how our systems are architected to how we implement our front ends and influencing design and usability. 

Everyone is passionate about what they do, and as long as you have a get up and go attitude and are self-motivated, you can get involved in pretty much everything.

OK, I’m interested. What experience do I need to have?

We would like you to have experience in
.NET C# development Front-end development (we don’t need you to be a UI/UX expert but awareness of some modern frameworks and techniques will be useful) Distributed systems and APIs Working knowledge of SQL (we don’t need you to be a DBA) Cloud platforms (Azure preferred) 

Bonus points for:
Azure experience (for example app services, azure functions, azure service bus, event hubs) Domain Driven Design Infrastructure as code (for example Terraform/ARM/Bicep/Ansible) Implementing authentication and authorisation mechanisms (for example, OAuth2) GitHub profile, blog posts, contributing to opensource projects Vue JS (our preferred choice for our apps); experience migrating away from AngularJS 

We know from research and experience that candidates may not apply if they don’t feel they meet 100% of our requirements. If you don’t tick all the boxes but feel you would be a good fit, we would still love to hear from you. We are committed to creating a diverse and inclusive culture!

Just to let you know too, we will need you to have the Right To Work in the UK, and as we work closely with the NHS, if we get to the stage where we make you an offer to join us, we will also need to undertake a DBS check.

We are perfect for each other! What are the next steps?

We are currently recruiting heavily and have a lot of CVs to go through. However, we don’t wait for roles to close before going through your CV. We will be in touch in a few days to let you know if we think we might be a match, and if we are not. Unfortunately, because we get so many CV’s we are not able to send an individual response if it’s not a match. However, if you want more details as to why, just drop us a note and we will arrange to get some feedback over to you.

If it’s a match, then we will arrange a time to talk to you on a quick 30 minute call. It’s just an informal chat so you can relax! We will tell you more about the role, the team and why you should want to join us.

If we continue, then we will invite you in to meet the team and founders. Depending on your role we may also ask you to complete an assessment.

We get there are a lot of great roles out there, so we will make sure to get through the rounds as quickly as possible. All we ask is you keep us up to date with your plans.

I can’t wait to get started, what are the perks?

As a result, we do not overwhelm engineers with unrealistic expectations/requirements, and we can therefore move forward much faster. Well, we don't have unrealistic expectations/requirements in the first place, since we see our roadmap as a set of high-level goals and we have no fixed timelines on deploying features - we want to get things to production as fast as possible.

We do that by pushing features behind a feature flag - so not all users see all features, but our production is always updated. This brings zero-downtime deployments, backward compatible features, and similar challenges since our users should never be impacted.

We follow SCRUM loosely - our engineers have one sync meeting per week, async text Slack dailies, we have no dedicated QA people, we work in super small & independent teams, we have no Jira and in our team, we only have engineers, no code monkeys.

For us, it's simple: give people time to do deep work. And help specify features that are limited in scope while discouraging hacky workarounds.

It's early for us and we don't know how right we are yet. But after two years of building our product team and core engineering principles, we can see that we are on the right track. Progress over perfection.

Working for Synthesia means working independently, making technical decisions and being responsible for them, being enabled and involved in the whole process of SDLC, and most importantly, putting arguments over ego. 😏

Urban Marovt, Fullstack developer @ Synthesia

Our stack & some context

We started to work on our main product - Synthesia STUDIO - almost two years ago with a very small team of engineers (BE and FS). We now have a functional MVP, that we develop, push forward and improve constantly but on the other hand, we have 3000+ daily users, and last year alone we generated 6+ million videos. 🤯 While we know, we have a long way to go, to bring our product to where we want it to be, we also have to be mindful of our existing userbase, which is also really involved with us and provides great feedback for each update and new feature we roll out.

We have a lot of custom components and multiple layers of complexity, our product is constantly changing but if we try to sum up our stack:
Frontend is JavaScript/HTML/CSS using React.js + Redux;Backend is a mix of Python, Flask, Node.js, and C++ components that are mostly containerized with Docker, and hosted on a number of AWS services (Lambda, Fargate, EC2, EKS)ATM we have a self-hosted CI/CD but we are hiring our first dedicated DevOps Engineer as we speak, so we expect our operations will change drastically in the near future

If you join us you can either work remotely from Europe (GMT 0 +/- 2), from any of the offices or if you're not in any of these cities we can pay for a seat in a co-working space if needed.

 When was Synthesia founded?

Synthesia was founded in 2017 by a team of researchers and entrepreneurs from UCL, Stanford, TUM, and Oxford University. Notably one of the co-founders of the company is behind some of the most well-recognized research projects in the field, Deep Video Portraits, and Face2Face. The founding team members are:
Victor Riparbelli - CEOSteffen Tjerrild - CFO/COOProf Matthias NiessnerProf Lourdes Agapito Who are our investors?

Initial funding came from Mark Cuban and further investment was led by LDV Capital, joined by new investors MMC Ventures, Seedcamp, Martin Varsavsky's VAS Ventures, TransferWise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus, Tiny VC, and advertising executive Nigel Morris.

In Series A we raised $12.5M led by Firstmark Capital FirstMark Capital, with participation from angels Christian Bach (CEO, Netlify) and Michael Buckley (VP Communications, Twilio), as well as existing investors LDV Capital, MMC Ventures, Seedcamp, Mark Cuban, Taavet Hinrikus, Martin Varsavsky and TinyVC.

In Series B we raised $50 million led by Kleiner Perkins, with participation from Google Ventures and existing investors Firstmark Capital, LDV Capital, Seedcamp and MMC Ventures.
 What's the culture like and what are our principles?

At Synthesia we're passionate about building. Not talking, planning, or politicising. We strive to hire the smartest, kindest, and most unrelenting people and let them do their best work without distractions.

Our work principles serve as our charter for how we make decisions, give feedback, and structure our work to empower everyone to go as fast as possible.
Long term thinking; short term execution 🙇‍♂️ We think in quarters, years, and decades. But we embrace that the path will take unpredictable twists and turns. We avoid both futile planning and directionless execution.Outcomes over Inputs & Plans 🚢 We value outcomes and iterations, not inputs. We keep planning and process work to a minimum and seek to reduce coordination costs and perfectionism in favor of velocity.Be an Owner 🤴🏼 Acting like an owner is encouraged: asking questions, challenging decisions and showing leadership as long as it's constructive. Career paths are forged by actions and ownership.Make the Journey Fun 🤪 What's the point if we're not having fun? We strive for an informal, low hierarchy culture where we can all be our true selves.Default to Simple 🧶Simple is better - until it's not. But in most cases, we can stick to very simple solutions until we've proven that it's working and there is a need for a more robust and sophisticated solution.Radical Candor 🤡 Shying away from giving honest feedback is detrimental to excellence. We pride ourselves on being candid in a kind and compassionate manner. What's the work/life balance like at Synthesia?

We don't have any mandated core hours and in line with our culture, we trust our co-workers to be adult professionals that will do their jobs. We have a standard 40 hours workweek, with flexible working time. Most of us being located in the same time zone makes it easier for us to synchronize but we encourage asynchronous communication whenever possible so people can focus with the least amount of interruptions. We are a diverse group of professionals, from singles, youngsters, middle-aged couples to parents with kids of all ages. We are trying to make it work for everyone, to empower everyone to be a productive member of the team while hustling challenges life throws at all of us.

OK, that’s me, but who are DrDoctor?

DrDoctor is a HealthTech company on an exciting growth trajectory. Our technology focuses on engaging patients across their healthcare journey while saving hospitals time, effort, and money.

Our Mission is that healthcare needs a reset. More people need care every day and health services struggle. Current patient engagement is a mess of disparate systems that hinder, rather than help care delivery.

Our Vision is a remote-first healthcare system, which can meet demand without sacrificing care quality. We want patients to be engaged in their care, shifting to a digital first model.

We do this at scale:
10 million+ patients use DrDoctor We manage over 50 million appointments We work with over 40 NHS Trusts and Health Boards 

We :green_heart: the NHS and want to help it work better. We radically transform the delivery of health services to make healthcare work for everyone – for patients, doctors, administrative teams and taxpayers.

Tell me more! Who will I be working with?

In this role you really will interact with every part of the business, even as we grow. But meet Natalia...

Hi, I am Natalia and I have been at DrDoctor as a Fullstack Developer for over 1.5 years. It has been a fantastic learning experience for me, and it is great place to work. Everyone is very friendly and helpful, and the company has a good working culture. 

The problems that I solve every day are genuinely interesting and make a real impact on people’s lives and the NHS. We use modern technologies and look after the health of our code base. What is really cool, is that we are not limited to work only on one project, it is pretty much your choice and there are opportunities to try working on different products. 

There are also lots of learning opportunities, training budget, personal development time and team support if you want to learn interesting new tech and bring it back to your pod (that is how we call our teams). 

DrDoctor not only supports our career but creates a supportive, inclusive environment and makes a great effort to ensure we look after our mental health and wellbeing and have healthy work-life balance. There are initiatives such as duvet days and OpenUp consultations available, and the amazing People Team looking after everyone.

OK, I’m interested. What experience do I need to have?

Just to let you know too, we will need you to have the Right To Work in the UK, and as we work closely with the NHS, if we get to the stage where we make you an offer to join us, we will also need to undertake a DBS check.

However, if you want more details as to why, just drop us a note and we will arrange to get some feedback over to you.

If it’s a match, then we will arrange a time to talk to you on a quick 30 minute call. It’s just an informal chat so you can relax! We will tell you more about the role, the team and why you should want to join us.

Here is how our Synthesia STUDIO looks like today:
